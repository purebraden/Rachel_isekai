# Rachel Isekai — Global Voice & Drafting Rules (Act 1+)

These rules are **binding** for all future drafting and revision unless explicitly overridden.

---

## 1. Chapter Scope Rule (Stephen King Scale)
- Chapters must be **chapters, not scenes**
- Minimum target: **3,000–4,000 words**
- Each chapter must span:
  - multiple emotional beats
  - at least two time states (before/after, morning/evening, arrival/aftermath)
- The inciting event of a chapter **may not end the chapter**

If an event happens early, the chapter must live with it.

---

## 2. Interior Mess Rule
Rachel is allowed to be:
- contradictory
- emotionally inefficient
- wrong about herself
- avoidant of certain thoughts
- circular in thinking

Banned:
- clean emotional processing
- immediate insight
- tidy realizations

Thoughts may:
- trail off
- double back
- contradict earlier sentences
- be dismissed without resolution

---

## 3. Negation Minimization Rule
Avoid:
- “not X, not Y”
- “no this, no that”
- explaining absence instead of presence

Replace with:
- concrete alternatives
- irritation, humor, or denial
- describing what *is* happening instead of what isn’t

Negation is allowed **only** when Rachel is actively defensive or sarcastic.

---

## 4. Sentence Entry Rotation Rule (Hard Rule)
No more than **two consecutive sentences** may begin with the same word.

Including:
- She / she / she
- You / you / you
- It / it / it
- And / and / and
- Then / then / then

Rotate entry points using:
- objects
- sensations
- setting
- time
- dependent clauses
- interruptions

---

## 5. Pronoun De-Emphasis
Rachel remains the POV anchor, but sentences should not always lead with her name or pronoun.

Prefer:
- “The coffee burned.”
- “The room smelled like dust.”
- “For a second, the world went quiet.”

Over:
- “She drank the coffee.”
- “She noticed the smell.”
- “She heard silence.”

---

## 6. Calm Is Allowed, Clean Is Not
The tone may be:
- grounded
- quiet
- observational

But must **not** be:
- emotionally sterile
- over-controlled
- procedural

Human inefficiency is required.

---

## 7. Magic Presentation Rule
- Magic appears as **effect first**
- No system explanation on first encounter
- Rachel notices changes before meaning
- Understanding lags experience by chapters, not paragraphs

---

## 8. Social & Emotional Friction Rule
Even in friendly scenes:
- something should feel slightly misaligned
- Rachel should want and resist at the same time
- comfort should come with a subtle cost

If a scene feels pleasant, ask:
“What is Rachel quietly giving up here?”

---

## 9. Ending Rule
Chapters should end on:
- discomfort
- unresolved awareness
- a question Rachel avoids finishing

Do **not** end on:
- explanations
- thematic summaries
- emotional closure

---

## 10. Revision Trigger Checklist
Revise immediately if you see:
- multiple pronoun-led sentences in a row
- negation scaffolding building rhythm
- paragraphs that feel too correct
- scenes that resolve too cleanly
- Rachel processing emotions efficiently

---

## 11. Drafting Priority
When in conflict, prioritize:
1. Lived mess
2. Interior friction
3. Rhythm and flow
4. Clarity
5. Polish

Polish is last.

---

## 12. Act 1 Override Note
These rules are **strictest in Act 1**.
Later acts may tighten naturally as Rachel gains self-knowledge.
