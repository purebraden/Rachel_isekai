# Global Drafting Rule — Humanized Voice Lock

This rule governs **first-draft prose** for this project.

Its purpose is to preserve *human presence* and prevent over-optimization during drafting.

---

## PRIME DIRECTIVE

**Draft as if no one is evaluating the prose. Meaning is allowed to emerge late.**

If a choice must be made, always prioritize:
- humanity over clarity
- truth over neatness
- presence over efficiency

---

## GLOBAL DRAFTING PERMISSIONS

These are **allowed behaviors**, not mistakes.

- Redundancy is allowed if it reflects how a person circles a thought.
- Scenes may linger after their plot function is complete.
- Objects, sensations, and spaces persist through dialogue.
- Emotional reactions may lag behind events.
- Some sentences exist only because they feel true.
- Conversations may overlap, trail off, or resolve incompletely.
- Rachel is allowed to notice things that do not matter to the plot.
- Moments are allowed to feel awkward, indulgent, or unresolved.

---

## DEFERRED JUDGMENT RULE

During first drafts:

- Do **not** perform cadence correction.
- Do **not** hunt for AI tells.
- Do **not** tighten language for elegance.
- Do **not** remove lines simply because they feel strange.

You may only correct:
- comprehension failures
- continuity errors
- factual inaccuracies

All stylistic judgment is deferred to later passes.

---

## PRACTICAL APPLICATION

When drafting a new chapter:

- Keep a humanized anchor chapter (e.g., Chapter 9 or 10) open.
- Match its *permission level*, not its phrasing.
- If the prose feels messier, looser, or slightly embarrassing, you are drafting correctly.

---

## MODE INVOCATION

This drafting posture has a name:

**Human Pass**

Before drafting, explicitly enter this mode.

> “I am drafting in Human Pass.”

---

## REINTRODUCING CONSTRAINTS (LATER)

Only after a chapter exists and can be read cleanly without dissociation:

- Apply light cadence smoothing if needed.
- Perform continuity and clarity checks.
- Conduct a *gentle* AI-tell sweep.

Never apply these constraints during first drafting.

---

## FINAL NOTE

This rule exists to protect the story from premature polish.

A chapter that feels alive but imperfect is always preferable to one that is clean and hollow.
