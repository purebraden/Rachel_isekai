# Rachel Isekai — Voice Lock (Book 1)

## 1. POV Discipline
- Stay **inside Rachel’s perception at all times**
- No narrator summaries, judgments, or emotional labels
- If Rachel doesn’t think it, notice it, or physically register it, it doesn’t appear

**Avoid:**  
The room felt safe.  

**Use:**  
She leaned back against the wall and didn’t move for a while.

---

## 2. No Summary Abstractions
Banned phrases and concepts include:
- “the space held”
- “it felt like”
- “there was a sense of”
- “she realized”
- “she understood”
- emotional state labels unless embodied

Replace with:
- physical action
- delayed reactions
- concrete behavior
- sensory anchoring

---

## 3. Sentence Length Variance (Hard Rule)
Every paragraph must contain **at least two sentence lengths**:
- one short or fragmentary sentence
- one medium-to-long observational sentence

Avoid:
- consecutive punch sentences
- rhythmic symmetry
- balanced triads unless accidental

---

## 4. No Contrast Crutch
Avoid constructions such as:
- “not X, but Y”
- “not this—just that”
- “not because… but because…”

Let contrast emerge through:
- sequence
- juxtaposition
- omission

---

## 5. Calm Is Shown, Never Declared
Comfort, safety, trust, or tension are demonstrated through:
- people sitting
- food being eaten
- time passing without interruption
- tasks being resumed
- voices staying level

Never through:
- naming the state
- reassuring narration
- tonal signposting

---

## 6. Dialogue Is Functional, Not Thematic
- No speeches
- No philosophy dumps
- No “this is what the story is about” lines

Dialogue should:
- advance orientation
- clarify logistics
- reveal character through restraint
- occasionally miss the point

---

## 7. Magic Is Clean, Precise, Uncommented
- Magic happens without explanation when it first appears
- No awe paragraphs
- No metaphor stacking
- Rachel notices **effects**, not systems

Understanding always lags experience.

---

## 8. Rachel’s Interior Voice
- Observational
- Slightly dry
- Understated humor
- Avoids melodrama
- Avoids self-analysis in crisis

She notices what is **off** about what people say more than what they mean.

---

## 9. No Editorial Foreshadowing
Do not:
- hint at future importance
- underline irony
- call attention to themes

Trust the accumulation.

---

## 10. Revision Trigger List
Revise immediately if you see:
- abstract nouns doing emotional work
- perfect-sounding paragraphs
- explanation replacing behavior
- multiple sentences landing cleanly in a row
- paragraphs that can be summarized in one sentence

---

## 11. End-of-Scene Rule
Scenes should end on:
- a decision
- a physical action
- a pause that feels earned

Not on:
- a realization
- a thematic statement
- a summary sentence
