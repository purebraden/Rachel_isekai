In chapter 28 
sivara asks Rachel if anyone has come looking for her and she should have told her about the demons that visited her and Vex with the dream searching.  

In chapter 27 there’s some repetition about being unprecedented 


One of the demons even called her Rachel daughter of Theren … that feels like something she should mention. 

The training with Sivara feels awfully short.  I think I want to see more … like Rachel offering to fix/smooth some of the boundary issues in town.    More training examples other than just a vague learning terms reference.  

We’re also condensing a lot of the conversation in our group down to just repetition of we’re here with you because we choose to be. I think we need to vary this a little more.  The characters are starting to feel very two dimensional in a "we are just here to support Rachel" kind of way.   I think while Rachel is training they should be doing research or other activities and sharing details of those in the evening when they talk to Rachel. 

Then from chapter 29 which sounds like they’re preparing for this 3 week journey … suddenly chapter 30 has us in Sivara’s residence again.   I think we merged chapters and somehow have a duplicated chapter.  Although the second training has more info like names being important.   The second training sequence with sivaria is much more detailed and we need to keep that.  But probably add to it.   We definitly need to
Move the suggestion to go see the council several chapters out. 

We need more interactions with Rachel and the demons Sivaria just introduced her to in chapter 31. 

Also the "I notice you" interaction between Rachel and Arathen feels too superficial.  I know I had asked you to seed more into the book earlier (but I kept reading an older vision) so i just need to make sure we are earning the interest … and we need to make that exchange a little less awkwardly forced.
