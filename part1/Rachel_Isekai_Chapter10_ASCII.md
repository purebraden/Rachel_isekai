# Chapter Ten

Arathen did not call it a test at first.

He stood with his hands in his pockets like they were waiting for a bus, looking around the room the way a person does before sitting down somewhere new, as if the arrangement of chairs and tables might tell him something useful about the people who lived there.

Rachel sat at the table with her hands wrapped around a cup that was not doing much for her. The warmth helped for about three seconds before her nerves swallowed it whole, leaving her with the familiar hum under her skin.

Ilyra leaned against the wall near the doorway, arms folded, eyes doing their usual sweep that made Rachel feel like the room had exits she had not noticed yet. Edrin hovered close to the shelves with a book half-open, pretending he was not itching to annotate reality. Maelin sat nearer to Rachel than the others, close enough that Rachel could borrow her calm without having to admit she was doing it.

Arathen looked at Rachel again, not at the cup or her hands, but at her.

"All right," he said, voice light, almost conversational. "We're going to try something small."

Rachel's mouth tightened. "Define small."

Arathen smiled. "Small enough that if it goes wrong, we can all pretend we meant to do it."

Ilyra snorted, the sound brief and sharp.

Edrin's eyes widened as if he wanted to object to the logic of that, then thought better of it.

Rachel did not smile. She wanted to. She did not trust her face.

"What are we doing?" she asked.

"We're learning how you and the environment negotiate," Arathen said. "That's all."

"That's not--" Rachel started, then stopped herself.

Arathen watched her for a beat longer. "You get to stop at any point," he said. "You can say no."

Rachel exhaled slowly. "And if it doesn't stop?"

Arathen did not look away. "Then I stop it," he said simply. "Or we all leave the room."

"Okay," Rachel said, and meant it more than she expected to.

Arathen moved the table a few inches, the scrape of wood against stone soft but deliberate, then nudged two chairs back to open the space between them.

"Rachel," he said, "pick something you can stop."

"I don't want to use glass," she said.

"Good," Arathen said immediately.

He reached into his pocket and produced a small wooden bead, setting it on the table near the edge.

"I'm going to roll it," he said. "You stop it before it hits the floor."

The bead rolled.

Rachel reacted before she planned to. Her attention narrowed, and the room seemed to tighten around it, not visibly, but enough that she felt resistance gather under her skin.

The bead reached the edge and hung there.

She had not moved.

"Good," Arathen said softly.

A moment passed, stretching thin.

"Let it go," he said.

Rachel released whatever she had been holding. The bead dropped and rolled under the table, tapping once before settling.

"Again," Arathen said.

This time the pressure came faster, heavier, like the room remembered what she had done and met her halfway. The bead stopped late, hanging lower than before, its weight pulling at the pause.

The air around it went thin and cold.

"Stop," Arathen said.

Rachel looked at him.

"I'm not talking to the bead," he said.

She realized she was still holding, muscles locked in a way that had nothing to do with her hands.

"Breathe," Arathen said.

She did.

The bead dropped and rolled away, slower this time, as if reluctant to finish the motion.

Arathen did not smile.

"That felt different," Rachel said, the words coming out quiet and precise.

"Yes," Arathen said.

Edrin whispered something under his breath and then stopped himself, cheeks flushing.

Arathen picked up his mug, realized it was empty, and set it back down without drinking, attention still fixed on the space where the bead had paused.

"For now," he said, quieter, "we keep this small."

No one argued.

Rachel's attention drifted back to the bead on the table. It sat where he had left it, plain wood, smooth surface, nothing remarkable about it at all.

She waited for the room to settle the way it usually did, for the pressure to ease and the hum to fade back into the background.

It did not.

The air held its shape a fraction too long, like it was expecting something else to happen.

Rachel curled her fingers against her palm and stayed still, listening to the faint vibration under the floorboards, trying to tell whether the pressure she felt was fading --

-- or waiting.
