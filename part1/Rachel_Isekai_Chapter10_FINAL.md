## Chapter Ten

Arathen didn’t call it a test at first.

He stood with his hands in his pockets like they were waiting for a bus, looking around the room the way a person looks around before they sit down somewhere new, as if the chair arrangement might tell him something about the people who lived there.

Rachel sat at the table with her hands wrapped around a cup that wasn’t doing much for her. The warmth helped for about three seconds, and then her nerves swallowed it.

Ilyra leaned against the wall near the doorway, arms folded, eyes doing their usual sweep that made Rachel feel like the room had exits she hadn’t noticed. Edrin hovered close to the shelves with a book half-open, like he was trying to pretend he wasn’t itching to annotate reality. Maelin sat nearer to Rachel than the others, close enough that Rachel could borrow her calm without having to admit she was doing it.

Arathen looked at Rachel again. Not at the cup. Not at her hands. At her.

“Alright,” he said, voice light, almost conversational. “We’re going to try something small.”

Rachel’s mouth tightened. “Define small.”

Arathen smiled. “Small enough that if it goes wrong, we can all pretend we meant to do it.”

Ilyra snorted.

Edrin’s eyes widened like he wanted to object to the logic of that, then thought better of it.

Rachel didn’t smile. She wanted to. She didn’t trust her face.

“What are we doing?” she asked.

“We’re learning how you and the environment negotiate,” Arathen said. “That’s all.”

“That’s not—” Rachel started, then stopped.

Arathen watched her for a beat longer. “You get to stop at any point,” he said. “You can say no.”

Rachel exhaled slowly. “And if it doesn’t stop?”

Arathen didn’t look away. “Then I stop it,” he said simply. “Or we all leave the room.”

“Okay,” Rachel said.

Arathen moved the table a few inches. He nudged two chairs back.

“Rachel,” he said, “pick something you can stop.”

“I don’t want to use glass,” she said.

“Good,” Arathen said.

He produced a small wooden bead and set it on the table.

“I’m going to roll it,” he said. “You stop it before it hits the floor.”

The bead rolled.

Rachel reacted before she planned. The room tightened around her attention.

The bead reached the edge and hung there.

She hadn’t moved.

“Good,” Arathen said softly.

“Let it go,” he said a moment later.

Rachel released. The bead dropped and rolled under the table.

“Again,” Arathen said.

This time the pressure came faster. The bead stopped late, hanging lower than before.

The air around it went thin and cold.

“Stop,” Arathen said.

Rachel looked at him.

“I’m not talking to the bead,” he said.

She realized she was still holding.

“Breathe,” Arathen said.

She did.

The bead dropped. It rolled slower this time.

Arathen didn’t smile.

“That felt different,” Rachel said.

“Yes,” Arathen said.

Edrin whispered something and stopped himself.

Arathen picked up his mug, realized it was empty, and set it back down without drinking.

“For now,” he said, quieter, “we keep this small.”

No one spoke.

Rachel’s attention drifted back to the bead on the table. It sat where he’d left it, plain wood, smooth surface, nothing remarkable about it at all.

She waited for the room to settle the way it usually did.

It didn’t.

The air held its shape a fraction too long, like it was expecting something else to happen.

Rachel curled her fingers against her palm and stayed still, listening to the faint hum under the floorboards, trying to tell whether the pressure she felt was fading—

—or waiting.
