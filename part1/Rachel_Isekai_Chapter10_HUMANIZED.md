## Chapter Ten

Arathen didn’t call it a test, which made Rachel trust it less.

He stood near the table with his hands in his pockets, not pacing, not still, just sort of occupying space like he was waiting for something to happen on its own. He looked around the room the way people do when they’re trying to decide whether a place feels familiar enough to sit down in.

Rachel watched him over the rim of a mug that had gone lukewarm without her noticing. The warmth helped for a second or two and then disappeared into the background hum she was starting to associate with the building itself.

Ilyra leaned against the wall near the doorway, arms folded, boots braced like the floor might decide to move. Edrin hovered too close to the shelves, book open but unread, eyes flicking between Arathen and Rachel like he was trying to follow a conversation that hadn’t started yet. Maelin sat close to Rachel, not touching, but near enough that Rachel could feel the difference.

Arathen glanced at her again. Not at the mug. Not at her hands. At her face.

“Alright,” he said. “We’ll try something small.”

Rachel didn’t answer right away. She waited for the room to react. It didn’t.

“Define small,” she said.

He smiled, quick and unbothered. “Small enough that if it goes sideways, we can all pretend that was the plan.”

Ilyra snorted before she could stop herself.

Edrin looked alarmed, then seemed to realize he’d already agreed to this by staying in the room.

Rachel didn’t smile. She felt like if she did, it would stick on her face in a way she wouldn’t be able to explain later.

“What are we doing?” she asked.

“We’re watching,” Arathen said. “And listening. You, mostly.”

“That’s not an answer.”

He tilted his head. “It’s the only one I’ve got right now.”

Rachel exhaled through her nose and set the mug down. The sound it made against the table felt louder than it should have.

“You can stop whenever you want,” Arathen added. “Say no, say pause, say ‘this feels wrong.’”

“And if it doesn’t stop?” Rachel asked.

Maelin shifted slightly beside her. Edrin stilled completely.

Arathen didn’t look away. “Then I stop it,” he said. “Or we leave the room.”

Rachel didn’t like either option, but she nodded anyway. “Okay.”

Arathen moved the table a few inches, not straining, not asking for help. Chairs slid back with a soft scrape. The room felt different afterward, like it had been told to expect something.

“Pick something you can stop,” he said.

Rachel’s first thought was glass. The memory came uninvited — the pause, the way the world had seemed to hold its breath with her.

“I don’t want to use glass,” she said.

“Good,” Arathen said immediately, like he’d hoped she’d say that.

He reached into his bag and pulled out a small wooden bead, smooth and dark, the kind of thing that could have been part of a necklace or a toy or nothing important at all.

“It rolls,” he said, holding it up. “That’s enough.”

Rachel stared at it. “That’s it?”

“That’s it.”

He set it on the table. The bead looked ordinary. Innocent, even.

“I’m going to roll it,” Arathen said. “You stop it before it hits the floor.”

Rachel’s stomach tightened. She nodded anyway.

Edrin’s pen twitched against his page and then froze when Rachel looked at him. He mouthed sorry without sound.

Ilyra shifted her stance, subtle, like she was lining herself up with exits Rachel hadn’t noticed.

Arathen rolled the bead.

It moved faster than Rachel expected. Her body reacted before her brain could catch up. The room narrowed around her attention, like everything else had politely stepped aside.

Stop.

The bead reached the edge and just… stayed there.

Not balanced. Not wobbling. Just hanging, half over empty space.

Rachel sucked in a breath she hadn’t meant to take.

She hadn’t moved.

The air around the bead felt wrong — quieter, like sound had been turned down without permission.

“Good,” Arathen said softly.

Rachel’s heart hammered. “I did that?”

“Yes,” Maelin said. Her voice was steady, but her eyes were wide.

Ilyra let out a slow breath. “Okay.”

Edrin whispered something that might have been her name and then clamped his mouth shut.

“Let it go,” Arathen said gently.

Rachel blinked. “Let it—”

“Release,” he said. “Whatever you’re doing to keep it there.”

Rachel hesitated. Her instincts screamed that letting go meant breaking something, that gravity would punish her for interfering.

But it was just a bead.

She exhaled and loosened whatever grip she hadn’t realized she was holding.

The bead dropped, clicked against the floor, and rolled under the table.

Her knees went faint for a second.

Maelin’s hand hovered near her elbow, then withdrew when Rachel stayed upright.

“Nice,” Ilyra said, sounding almost impressed despite herself.

Arathen nodded once. “Again.”

Rachel’s mouth went dry. “Again?”

“One more time.”

Edrin looked like he wanted to argue. He didn’t.

Arathen retrieved the bead and set it back on the table. “This time,” he said, “don’t try to repeat it. Just notice.”

Rachel didn’t like that instruction at all.

He rolled the bead again.

Rachel reached instinctively, and immediately felt the difference. The pressure gathered faster, heavier, like the room was less patient this time. She felt resistance, like pushing against something that pushed back.

Stop—

The bead jerked, then froze too low, hanging awkwardly below the table edge.

Rachel’s stomach flipped.

The air around it felt thin and cold, like something had been scooped out and not put back properly.

Ilyra straightened. “Arathen.”

“I see it,” he said.

Rachel swallowed. “What did I do?”

“Nothing wrong,” Maelin said quickly, but she didn’t sound convinced.

Edrin stared at the space around the bead. “It’s different.”

“Stop,” Arathen said.

Rachel looked at him, confused. “It already—”

“I’m not talking to the bead.”

That landed.

Rachel realized she was still holding on, clenching the moment like it might tear loose if she didn’t. The pressure in her chest felt trapped, nowhere to go.

Arathen stepped closer, not crowding her, just breaking her line of sight to the table.

“Rachel,” he said. “Look at me.”

She did.

His eyes were steady. Not demanding. Just there.

“Breathe,” he said.

She obeyed before she decided to. In. Out.

The pressure eased a fraction. The cold absence around the bead softened.

“Good,” Arathen said. “Now let go.”

Rachel released.

The bead dropped. It hit the floor with a duller sound than before and rolled more slowly, like it was tired.

Rachel’s pulse thudded in her ears.

Arathen watched it roll until it stopped. He didn’t smile.

“That felt different,” Rachel said quietly.

“Yes,” he said.

Edrin opened his mouth, then shut it again.

Ilyra crossed her arms. “What’s the risk?”

Arathen didn’t answer right away. He picked up his mug, realized it was empty, and set it back down.

“For now,” he said, “we keep this small.”

No one argued.

Rachel’s gaze drifted back to the bead on the table. It looked like nothing. Just wood. Smooth. Ordinary.

She waited for the room to settle.

It didn’t.

The air held its shape a moment too long, like it was waiting for something else to happen.

Rachel curled her fingers into her palm and stayed very still, listening to the hum under the floorboards, trying to tell whether the pressure she felt was fading—

—or waiting.
