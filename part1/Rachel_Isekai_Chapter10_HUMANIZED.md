## Chapter Ten

They didn't leave right away.

Rachel had expected urgency—a plan formed quickly, bags packed, the door closing behind them before the morning finished settling. That was how things worked when people realized they'd miscalculated. But the hours stretched instead, time moving without purpose or direction. The house breathed around them, patient and watchful, as if it had decided they weren't finished yet.

Rachel sat on the floor near the table, back pressed against one of the legs, knees drawn up. She hadn't chosen the spot consciously. It had simply become where she was, listening to the scrape of chair legs as Edrin rearranged furniture for reasons he didn't articulate. Small movements. Adjustments that might have meant something or nothing.

Ilyra stood in the doorway, arms folded, gaze distant. Counting something internal—breaths or heartbeats or decisions. Maelin moved through the space washing things that were already clean, hands occupied with purpose where her mind couldn't settle. Arathen remained at the window, attention fixed on the clearing beyond as if waiting for the landscape to offer answers.

No one spoke.

The silence pressed in from all sides, thick with unspoken decisions.

Rachel realized she was waiting for someone to tell her what they'd concluded. What verdict they'd reached about her. About what came next.

The realization bothered her more than the quiet did.

"Is this the part," she said finally, voice steadier than she felt, "where someone explains what happens now?"

Ilyra glanced toward Arathen. He didn't turn from the window.

"We're still deciding," Maelin said. Her tone stayed gentle, careful.

Rachel's jaw tightened. "You're waiting for something."

Edrin stopped moving chairs. "We are," he said, then flinched as if he'd spoken out of turn.

"For what?" Rachel asked.

He hesitated, fingers curling against the chair back. "For you to… stabilize."

The word sat wrong in her mouth. Rachel wanted to laugh—felt the impulse rise sharp and bitter—but swallowed it instead. "I don't think that's happening."

Ilyra's expression stayed flat. "He means the magic. Not you."

"That doesn't help," Rachel said.

Arathen finally turned from the window. His gaze settled on Rachel with that same careful attention he'd given the bead—measuring not her worth, but what existed in this moment. When he spoke, his voice carried a weight she hadn't heard before.

"You're right," he said. "This isn't sustainable."

Rachel's chest tightened. "You mean me."

"I mean all of this," he said. "The waiting, the uncertainty. What we're asking you to carry." He moved away from the window, closer to the group. "You deserve better than being held in suspension."

The acknowledgment caught Rachel off guard.

Maelin moved closer and crouched nearby, arms resting on her knees. Her eyes found Rachel's. "We're not keeping you here. Not like this. We know you have a life you were pulled from. People who need to know you're alive."

"But you can't send me back," Rachel said.

"Not yet," Maelin admitted, and the regret in her voice sounded genuine. "But we're not giving up on finding a way."

Something in Rachel's chest loosened slightly at the honesty.

Rachel found a loose thread on her borrowed sleeve. Pulled it once. Stopped herself before she unraveled more. "I keep feeling like I walked into the middle of a conversation," she said. "Like you all know the context and I'm just guessing."

"That's not inaccurate," Ilyra said.

Rachel looked up at her. "Then tell me what I'm missing."

Edrin shifted uncomfortably, his book forgotten on the table behind him. "We were attempting something. A summoning."

"I know that part," Rachel said.

"You don't know why," he said.

She pushed herself upright, folding her legs beneath her, facing them properly now. "Then maybe you should tell me."

The room held its breath. Even the building's hum seemed to quiet, as if waiting.

Arathen spoke first. "We don't typically involve unwilling participants."

Rachel's jaw tightened. "And yet."

He acknowledged that with a slight nod. "And yet."

"We needed help," Maelin said. Her hands folded together, fingers interlacing and releasing in small, repetitive movements. "With something we didn't know how to handle alone."

Rachel frowned. "Help with what?"

Ilyra's expression stayed flat. "That's where it gets complicated."

"Try me," Rachel said.

Edrin rubbed at his temple, fingers pressing hard enough to leave marks. "The March has been expanding. Slowly, but measurably. Areas that were stable five years ago are fragmenting now. Trade routes collapse. Settlements evacuate. People disappear into boundary fractures."

"We've been trying to understand why," Maelin added. "To find a way to stabilize it. But the March doesn't follow normal rules. It's not just unstable—it's actively destabilizing everything around it."

"Like a wound that won't heal," Ilyra said flatly. "Gets worse if you don't treat it."

Rachel watched them carefully. "So you tried to summon something to fix it."

"Someone," Maelin corrected quietly. "Not something."

The distinction landed cold in Rachel's chest. "You were summoning a demon."

The word fell heavy into the silence.

No one denied it.

Rachel's mind filled with images—horns, fire, things that lurked in darkness. She must have made a face because Maelin spoke quickly.

"Not what you're thinking," Maelin said. "Demons here aren't—they're not evil. They're not monsters. It's just what we call beings who exist between worlds naturally. Boundary walkers."

"Like a species," Edrin added. "Not a judgment."

Rachel stared at them. "So when you say demon, you just mean... someone who can cross boundaries?"

"Someone who lives in the spaces between," Arathen clarified. "It's their nature, not their morality. Some are helpful. Some aren't. Like people."

"And there are different types," Edrin added. "Boundary walkers like Keleth specialize in dimensional magic—crossing between worlds, manipulating space and time. But there are others. Shadow demons, elemental demons, empaths. Different abilities, different natures."

The clarification settled uneasily. Rachel's whole life, the word demon had meant one thing. Here it meant something else entirely.

"Okay," Rachel said slowly. "So you were trying to summon a specific type. A boundary walker."

Edrin's voice came quiet. "A specific one. Keleth. She's helped stabilize fractures before, according to the records. We thought if anyone could understand what's happening to the March, could tell us how to stop it..."

"It would be someone who lives in those in-between spaces," Arathen finished.

Ilyra's arms remained folded. "Demons understand boundaries better than most. Keleth especially. She's helped stabilize fractures before, according to the records."

"But you got me instead," Rachel said.

"Yes," Edrin admitted. "And we still don't know why."

Rachel stared at the floor, at the grain of the wood, at anything but the people watching her process this. Something shifted inside her—not quite fear, not quite anger. Something older and less defined.

"So Keleth exists between worlds," Rachel said slowly. "And you thought that meant she could fix the March. But instead the summoning found... me."

"Someone else who exists between worlds," Arathen said quietly. "Or someone who could."

The implication hung heavy in the air.

Rachel pressed her palms flat against the floor, seeking stability in the solid, unchanging pressure of wood and stone.

"Did you know the summoning might fail?" she asked.

"Yes," Edrin said without hesitation.

"Did you know it might bring someone else? Someone who wasn't what you wanted?"

Silence answered her.

The absence of denial settled heavier than words could have.

Rachel nodded slowly. "All right."

The acknowledgment didn't carry forgiveness. Didn't carry understanding. It simply marked the limit of what she could process before something inside her fractured.

"But you still haven't told me," she said, voice dropping lower, "why this is happening to me specifically."

No one spoke.

Rachel's chest constricted. "I didn't have this before. I didn't feel—" She stopped, fingers curling against the floorboards. "I wasn't like this."

Maelin started to move closer. "Rachel—"

"No," Rachel said. The word came out harder than she'd intended. "I need to understand this part. I need to know why."

Her gaze fixed on Arathen. "You keep looking at me like you've already figured it out."

Arathen's eyes closed briefly. When they opened again, his expression had lost its measured calm, revealing something rawer beneath.

"I don't know everything," he said. "I wish I did."

Rachel's throat closed. "Then tell me what you do know. Please."

He stepped away from the window and, after a moment's hesitation, sat down across from her. Eye level. Equal.

"Magic doesn't manifest uniformly across worlds," he said. Each word came carefully, but not cold. Like he was handling something precious and breakable. "Some places hold it loosely. Others compress it until it becomes dense, resistant. This world pushes back against those who don't belong."

Rachel swallowed. "And I belong?"

"Most people who cross from your world to this one experience it as obstruction," he continued gently. "Exhaustion. A constant sense of being pushed away by something they can't see."

"But not me," Rachel said.

Arathen held her gaze, and his expression was kind. "You experience it as recognition. Like coming home to a place you've never been."

The room shifted around her—or perhaps she shifted and the room stayed still. Rachel couldn't tell which.

She wanted to laugh. Felt the impulse rise bitter and sharp in her throat. "That's not possible."

"It's rare," he said. "But you're not the first person this has happened to." The assurance seemed meant to comfort. "You're not alone in this."

"You're saying this world gave me something."

"I'm saying," Arathen corrected quietly, "this world allowed something that was always part of you. Something that had no room to exist where you were."

Rachel's hands formed fists against her thighs. "What does that mean?"

He hesitated, choosing his words carefully. His eyes tracked across her face like he was reading something written there in a language only he could see. "You told us you were adopted. That you'd always felt like something was missing, like you didn't quite fit anywhere."

Rachel's breath caught. "How is that relevant?"

Arathen's expression softened. "Because people who exist between worlds often come from... fractured origins. Not broken. Fractured. Split between what was and what could be. Your adoption left a gap in your history—a place where your story should have been solid but wasn't. That kind of incompleteness..." He paused, and for a moment something flickered across his expression—recognition, maybe, or suspicion carefully contained. "It can make someone permeable to other possibilities."

"You're choosing your words very carefully," Rachel said, watching him back.

"I'm trying not to make assumptions," Arathen said. "Not yet. But Rachel—the way magic moves through you, the way this world recognizes you... it's not typical. Even for someone who crosses boundaries accidentally."

"What are you not saying?" Rachel asked.

Arathen's mouth pulled into something that wasn't quite a smile. "That I have theories. And that I'd rather wait until we have more information before I share them."

Maelin spoke softly. "It means you weren't wrong there. The world was. You were always meant for somewhere with more space."

The gentleness in her voice nearly undid Rachel.

"So I was broken there," Rachel said, voice wavering. "And I'm fixed here."

"No," Edrin said urgently, leaning forward. "You were never broken. You were—" He struggled for the word. "Compressed. Like trying to exist in a space too small to hold you. That missing piece you felt? It wasn't something you lost. It was something you never had room to grow."

Rachel's throat closed. The missing piece. The gap she'd carried her whole life, the one she'd tried to fill with being fine, being useful, being small enough that no one would notice the hollow space inside her.

"Did you know that when you summoned me?" she asked.

"No," Edrin said, and there was real pain in his voice. "I swear, Rachel, we didn't know. But it explains why the working reached you instead of Keleth. You were—you are—someone who exists between worlds. Just like she does. The summoning found someone with the same... resonance."

Ilyra's voice came quieter than usual. "We didn't mean to pull you here. But maybe you were always meant to find your way to somewhere like this."

Rachel stood. The motion felt too abrupt, too uncontrolled. She took two steps and stopped, hands shaking.

"You're telling me," she said, "that I came here and suddenly I could do things I was never supposed to be able to do. That some part of me was just... waiting."

Maelin stood as well, moving to Rachel's side. "Rachel. It's not about what you were supposed to be. It's about what you are."

"I wasn't this person yesterday," Rachel said. Her voice cracked despite her effort to keep it level. "Yesterday I was—"

What? Fine? Functional? A person who fit, even if the fit was uncomfortable? Who had a boyfriend and a job and a life that made sense on paper even if it felt hollow?

Yesterday she'd been someone who belonged nowhere and had made peace with it.

Today she was someone who belonged here, in this impossible place with these impossible people, and that should have been wonderful except—

Except what did it say about her that she fit better with strangers in a foreign world than she'd ever fit with people who'd known her for years?

What did it say about her that some small, guilty part of her didn't want to go back?

"I don't know how to be this person," she said finally.

Arathen stood too, but kept his distance. "No one expects you to know yet."

Rachel pressed both palms against her eyes, breathing too fast, too shallow. "I hate not understanding." What she really hated was understanding too well.

"I know," Maelin said, and then she was there, hand resting between Rachel's shoulder blades. Not demanding. Just present. "I know this is frightening."

Rachel's breath hitched. She hadn't cried yet—not through any of this—but she felt dangerously close now.

Edrin's voice came soft and earnest. "We'll help you figure it out."

Arathen's tone shifted, more formal. "I want you to meet someone. Someone who understands what it's like to exist between worlds. Someone who's built a life doing exactly that."

Rachel lowered her hands slowly, and Maelin squeezed her shoulder once before stepping back.

"Someone like me," Rachel said.

Arathen's expression grew thoughtful, measuring. "Someone who shares your... particular relationship with boundaries. Her name is Sivara. She lives in Thornhaven, a trading town about a week's travel from here. Maybe more, depending on conditions and what we encounter along the way."

"And she can help me control this?" Rachel asked.

"She can show you how she manages her own abilities," Arathen said. "How she's lived among humans for years without incident."

Rachel frowned. "Why wouldn't she live among humans?"

A beat of silence.

Edrin cleared his throat. "Because she's a demon." The words came out like a confession.

Rachel's stomach dropped. Not because she expected horns or hellfire—they'd clarified that already—but because the word still carried weight. Boundary walker. Someone fundamentally other. Someone who existed in spaces Rachel was only beginning to understand.

"You're taking me to meet a demon," she said flatly.

"A boundary walker," Maelin corrected gently. "Like Keleth, the one we were trying to summon. Sivara exists in the spaces between worlds naturally. She understands the magic you're developing because it's similar to her own."

"Similar," Rachel repeated. Her mind was racing. "You think I'm like a demon."

Arathen measured his words. "We think you're manifesting abilities that shouldn't be possible for someone from your world. Sivara can help us understand why. And more importantly, she can teach you to live with them safely."

Rachel wanted to laugh. Wanted to scream. Instead she just stood there, processing the fact that she was being taken to meet an actual demon because her rescuers thought she had something in common with one.

"Does she know we're coming?" Rachel asked, grasping for practical questions.

"No," Arathen admitted. "We'll need to approach carefully. Sivara values her privacy and her integration into human society. She won't appreciate strangers showing up unannounced."

"But you think she'll help me anyway."

"I think she'll be curious enough to hear us out," Arathen said. "And once she sees what you can do, once she understands..." He paused. "She'll have questions. Just like I do."

The way he said it made Rachel's skin prickle. Like he was watching her even now, cataloging details, forming theories he wasn't ready to share.

"Okay," she said finally. "Okay. When do we leave?"

"Tomorrow," Arathen said. "If you're ready."

"We should go sooner," Rachel said, surprising herself. "Every day I'm here, the resonance gets stronger. You said it yourself—there's a timer on this. If Sivara can help me understand what's happening, help me figure out if I even can go back—" Her voice caught. "Then I need to meet her. Soon."

Arathen studied her for a moment, then nodded. "You're right. Tomorrow then. No delays."

Rachel closed her eyes briefly. Opened them. The world remained unchanged, but she felt steadier somehow. More in control.

"I'll never be ready," she said. "But let's go anyway."

Maelin smiled at that. "That's usually how it works."
