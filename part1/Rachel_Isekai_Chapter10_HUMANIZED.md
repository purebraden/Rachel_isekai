## Chapter Ten

Arathen didn't call it a test.

That omission made Rachel trust the whole thing less.

He stood near the table with his hands loose at his sides, weight shifting occasionally, occupying space the way water fills a container—without force, but completely. His attention moved across the room in careful sweeps, cataloging details she couldn't guess at.

Rachel watched him over the rim of a mug gone lukewarm. The ceramic pressed against her palms, grounding her to something solid even as the building's hum threaded up through the floor and into her bones. She'd stopped trying to ignore it. The sound—or feeling, or whatever it was—had become background, constant as her own pulse.

Ilyra leaned against the wall beside the doorway, arms folded, posture deceptively casual. Her eyes tracked Arathen's movements with the focus of someone waiting for a signal. Edrin hovered near the shelves, a book open in his hands but unread, gaze flicking between Arathen and Rachel like he was following a conversation no one had started yet. Maelin sat close—not touching, but near enough that Rachel felt the heat of her presence, steady and deliberate.

Arathen's gaze settled on Rachel's face. Not her hands. Not the mug. Her.

"We're going to try something," he said. "Small."

Rachel waited. The room held its breath with her.

"How small," she asked.

"Controlled," he said. "Measured. Something we can stop if it moves the wrong direction."

No one laughed. No one relaxed.

Rachel set the mug down. The sound of ceramic meeting wood landed heavier than it should have, as if the table had been waiting to acknowledge the contact.

"What are we doing?" she asked.

"Observing," Arathen said. "You, primarily."

Rachel's jaw tightened. "That's not an answer."

"It's the most accurate one I have." He pulled a chair out and sat, the motion unhurried. "I need to see what happens when you try something on purpose instead of by reflex."

The distinction settled cold in her chest.

"You can stop at any point," Arathen said. "The moment it feels wrong, we stop. I mean that."

Rachel swallowed. "And if I can't stop it myself?"

Maelin shifted beside her, close enough that Rachel could feel her warmth. "Then we will," she said quietly. "You're not doing this alone."

Edrin set his book aside completely, giving Rachel his full attention. "We're right here."

The simple assurances steadied Rachel more than elaborate promises could have.

Arathen stood and moved the table—not far, just enough to create space. The scrape of wood against stone felt loud in the quiet. Chairs followed, pushed back to widen the working area. The room rearranged itself around his movements, expectant now but not hostile.

"We'll use something simple," he said. "Something that can't hurt anyone if this goes wrong."

Rachel's first thought was glass—the cup, the pause, the way time had bent around her intention. The memory arrived sharp and unwelcome.

"Not glass," she said.

"Good instinct," Arathen said, and the approval in his voice was genuine. He reached into his bag and produced a wooden bead, small and dark, smooth from handling. "This was my daughter's. It's survived worse than a fall."

The personal detail caught Rachel off guard. Made the object less clinical, more human.

"It rolls," he said, holding it up for her to see. "Nothing else matters."

Rachel stared at it. Such a small thing. But he'd chosen something he cared about. Something that said I trust you.

He set it on the table with care. The bead sat there, ordinary and patient.

"I'm going to roll this toward the edge," Arathen said. His voice stayed level, but kind. "Stop it before it falls. That's all."

Rachel's stomach tightened. Her hands felt too warm, too aware of themselves. She nodded.

Edrin leaned forward slightly, ready to move if needed. "You can do this," he said softly.

Ilyra caught Rachel's eye and gave a small nod. Not pressure. Just presence.

Arathen rolled the bead.

It moved faster than she'd anticipated. Her body responded before thought could intercede—instinct ahead of decision. The room contracted around her focus, everything peripheral falling away until only the bead remained, wood against wood, motion against stillness.

Stop.

The word didn't leave her mouth. Didn't need to.

The bead reached the table's edge and held.

Not balanced. Not teetering. Just suspended, half over empty air, as if gravity had been asked politely to wait.

Rachel's breath caught high in her chest. She hadn't moved. Hadn't touched anything.

The air around the bead looked different—thinner somehow, like the space itself had been scooped hollow.

"Good," Arathen said, his voice careful and pleased. "Very good."

Rachel's pulse hammered in her ears. "I did that. I actually did that."

"You did," Maelin said, and Rachel could hear the smile in her voice even as her eyes stayed wide with wonder.

Ilyra exhaled slowly, and when Rachel glanced at her, she saw something that might have been pride. "Clean work."

Edrin looked like he wanted to say something—mouth opening, closing, opening again—before he finally managed, "That was remarkable."

The praise felt strange. Foreign. But not unwelcome.

"Let it go now," Arathen said gently. "You can release it."

Rachel stared at the bead. "How do I—"

"However feels natural," he said. "There's no wrong way."

"What am I even doing?" Rachel asked, staring at the suspended bead. "Is this time? Space? What am I actually controlling?"

Arathen considered his answer carefully. "You're manipulating the boundary between motion and stillness. Not stopping time itself—more like... creating a pocket where normal rules pause. A hesitation in reality."

"That's what the room tilt was," Edrin added quietly. "You pushed against gravity itself because gravity is just another boundary—between up and down, falling and floating."

Rachel's stomach turned. "So I could accidentally..."

"Yes," Arathen said simply. "Which is why we're being careful."

Her instincts screamed to drop everything, to never touch this power again. But she trusted them now, at least a little, and that made the difference.

She exhaled and loosened something she couldn't name—a grip that existed nowhere in her body but everywhere in her intention.

The bead dropped. Hit the floor. Rolled under the table with a hollow sound.

Rachel's knees went soft. Not enough to buckle. Just enough to notice.

The exhaustion she felt wasn't normal tired. It was the kind that came after using muscles you'd forgotten you had—muscles that had been atrophied, waiting, her whole life.

Using her abilities felt like waking up. Like finally breathing deep after years of shallow breaths. Like flexing a limb that had been bound too tight and discovering it was stronger than she'd ever imagined.

The rightness of it terrified her more than the magic itself ever could.

Maelin's hand found her elbow, steadying. "I've got you."

"I'm okay," Rachel said, but she didn't pull away from the support. Didn't want to. Back home, she would have. Would have smiled and insisted she was fine and retreated to process alone.

Here, she let herself be held.

"You are," Maelin agreed, squeezing gently before letting go.

Arathen nodded once, expression unreadable. "Again."

Rachel's throat went dry. "Again?"

"Once more."

Edrin looked stricken. Opened his mouth. Closed it without protest.

Arathen retrieved the bead, movements unhurried, and placed it back on the table. "This time," he said, "don't try to replicate what you did. Just observe."

The instruction settled wrong in Rachel's chest.

He rolled the bead.

Rachel reached for it instinctively—and the difference struck her at once.

The pressure gathered faster this time, heavier, as if the room had grown impatient with practice. She felt resistance where before there had been only compliance, like pressing against something that pressed back with equal force.

Stop—

The bead jerked mid-roll, then froze.

Too low.

It hung below the table's edge, suspended at an angle that made her eyes ache to follow.

Rachel's stomach turned over.

The air around the bead looked wrong—thin and cold, like something had carved out a hollow and forgotten to fill it back in. The space itself seemed wounded.

Ilyra straightened sharply. "Arathen."

"I see it."

Rachel's breath came shallow. "What did I—"

"You didn't do anything wrong," Maelin said, but the uncertainty in her voice undermined the reassurance.

Edrin stared at the empty space surrounding the bead, his face pale. "The displacement is visible."

"Rachel," Arathen said. His voice cut through without rising. "Stop."

She looked at him, confused. "It's already—"

"I'm not talking to the bead."

The words landed like cold water.

Rachel understood then. She was still holding on. Still gripping that nameless thing inside her chest, clenching it tight as if releasing it would tear something fundamental loose. The pressure built with nowhere to go, trapped and growing.

Arathen moved closer—not crowding, just positioning himself between her and the table, breaking her line of sight.

"Look at me," he said.

Rachel dragged her gaze away from the bead. Met his eyes.

Steady. Patient. Waiting.

"Breathe," he said.

She did. In through her nose. Out through her mouth. The way she'd learned in some forgotten wellness seminar, the kind of breathing that was supposed to fix things.

The pressure eased. Barely. Just enough.

The cold hollow around the bead softened at the edges.

"Good," Arathen said quietly. "Now let go."

Rachel released.

The bead fell. Hit the floor with a sound that felt muffled, wrong. It rolled slowly, as if moving through something thicker than air, before coming to rest against the table leg.

Rachel's pulse pounded in her temples.

Arathen watched the bead until it stopped completely. When he looked back at Rachel, concern had replaced clinical interest. "How do you feel?"

"Shaky," Rachel admitted. "That was harder."

"I know." He moved closer, studying her face. "Any pain? Dizziness?"

"No. Just tired."

Edrin looked stricken. "We should stop. That's enough for today."

"More than enough," Maelin agreed, already moving to Rachel's side. "You need to rest."

Ilyra's arms folded across her chest, but her voice came out gentler than usual. "That was brave. But Edrin's right. We're done."

"How much danger is she in?" Edrin asked Arathen directly, the words tumbling out. "If this keeps escalating—"

Arathen raised a hand, calming. "We proceed carefully from here. Smaller steps. More time between attempts." He looked at Rachel. "Nothing you're not ready for."

Rachel found herself grateful for their concern, even as part of her wanted to prove she could keep going. "What if I need to do it again? In an emergency?"

"Then you will," Arathen said. "And we'll be here to help." He retrieved the bead from the floor, rolling it gently between his fingers. "For now, we learn from what just happened instead of pushing forward."

Rachel's attention drifted back to the space where the bead had hung suspended. The air there looked normal now, but the memory of its wrongness lingered.

Maelin's hand rested briefly on her shoulder. "Come sit down. I'll make tea."

Rachel nodded, suddenly aware of how much she wanted exactly that—to sit, to have someone care for her in small ways, to not be alone with what she'd just discovered she could do.
