## Chapter Ten

Arathen didn't call it a test.

That omission made Rachel trust the whole thing less.

He stood near the table with his hands loose at his sides, weight shifting occasionally, occupying space the way water fills a container—without force, but completely. His attention moved across the room in careful sweeps, cataloging details she couldn't guess at.

Rachel watched him over the rim of a mug gone lukewarm. The ceramic pressed against her palms, grounding her to something solid even as the building's hum threaded up through the floor and into her bones. She'd stopped trying to ignore it. The sound—or feeling, or whatever it was—had become background, constant as her own pulse.

Ilyra leaned against the wall beside the doorway, arms folded, posture deceptively casual. Her eyes tracked Arathen's movements with the focus of someone waiting for a signal. Edrin hovered near the shelves, a book open in his hands but unread, gaze flicking between Arathen and Rachel like he was following a conversation no one had started yet. Maelin sat close—not touching, but near enough that Rachel felt the heat of her presence, steady and deliberate.

Arathen's gaze settled on Rachel's face. Not her hands. Not the mug. Her.

"We're going to try something," he said. "Small."

Rachel waited. The room held its breath with her.

"How small," she asked.

"Controlled," he said. "Measured. Something we can stop if it moves the wrong direction."

No one laughed. No one relaxed.

Rachel set the mug down. The sound of ceramic meeting wood landed heavier than it should have, as if the table had been waiting to acknowledge the contact.

"What are we doing?" she asked.

"Observing," Arathen said. "You, primarily."

Rachel's jaw tightened. "That's not an answer."

"It's the most accurate one I have." He pulled a chair out and sat, the motion unhurried. "I need to see what happens when you try something on purpose instead of by reflex."

The distinction settled cold in her chest.

"You can stop at any point," Arathen said. "Say the word and we're done."

Rachel swallowed. "And if I can't stop?"

Maelin's presence shifted beside her—a small intake of breath, quickly controlled. Edrin went very still, the book in his hands forgotten.

Arathen held her gaze. "Then I stop it. Or we clear the room."

Neither option reassured her. Rachel nodded anyway, the motion small and tight.

Arathen stood and moved the table—not far, just enough to create space. The scrape of wood against stone felt loud in the quiet. Chairs followed, pushed back to widen the working area. The room rearranged itself around his movements, expectant now.

"We'll use something simple," he said. "Something that can't hurt anyone if this goes wrong."

Rachel's first thought was glass—the cup, the pause, the way time had bent around her intention. The memory arrived sharp and unwelcome.

"Not glass," she said.

Arathen nodded once, as if she'd passed a test she hadn't known she was taking. He reached into his bag and produced a wooden bead, small and dark, smooth from handling. It could have been anything—part of a necklace, a child's toy, a counter for some game she didn't know.

"It rolls," he said, holding it up for her to see. "Nothing else matters."

Rachel stared at it. Such a small thing to carry so much weight.

He set it on the table with care. The bead sat there, ordinary and patient.

"I'm going to roll this toward the edge," Arathen said. His voice stayed level, instructional. "Stop it before it falls."

Rachel's stomach tightened. Her hands felt too warm, too aware of themselves. She nodded.

Edrin's pen trembled against his page. When Rachel's gaze landed on him, he froze, then mouthed something that might have been sorry.

Ilyra adjusted her stance—subtle, economical. Positioning herself between Rachel and the door without making it obvious.

Arathen rolled the bead.

It moved faster than she'd anticipated. Her body responded before thought could intercede—instinct ahead of decision. The room contracted around her focus, everything peripheral falling away until only the bead remained, wood against wood, motion against stillness.

Stop.

The word didn't leave her mouth. Didn't need to.

The bead reached the table's edge and held.

Not balanced. Not teetering. Just suspended, half over empty air, as if gravity had been asked politely to wait.

Rachel's breath caught high in her chest. She hadn't moved. Hadn't touched anything.

The air around the bead looked different—thinner somehow, like the space itself had been scooped hollow.

"Good," Arathen said. His voice came from far away, or perhaps she'd simply stopped hearing properly.

Rachel's pulse hammered in her ears. "That was me."

"Yes," Maelin said. Steady voice. Wide eyes.

Ilyra exhaled slowly through her nose, the sound deliberate.

Edrin's lips moved—her name, maybe, or something else—but no sound followed. He pressed his mouth shut.

"Let it go," Arathen said.

Rachel stared at the bead. "Let what—"

"Release it," he said. "Whatever you're holding."

Her instincts screamed otherwise. Letting go meant falling. Falling meant breaking. She'd interfered with something fundamental and now gravity would exact payment.

But it was only a bead.

She exhaled and loosened something she couldn't name—a grip that existed nowhere in her body but everywhere in her intention.

The bead dropped. Hit the floor. Rolled under the table with a hollow sound.

Rachel's knees went soft. Not enough to buckle. Just enough to notice.

Maelin's hand lifted toward her elbow, then withdrew when Rachel remained upright.

Arathen nodded once, expression unreadable. "Again."

Rachel's throat went dry. "Again?"

"Once more."

Edrin looked stricken. Opened his mouth. Closed it without protest.

Arathen retrieved the bead, movements unhurried, and placed it back on the table. "This time," he said, "don't try to replicate what you did. Just observe."

The instruction settled wrong in Rachel's chest.

He rolled the bead.

Rachel reached for it instinctively—and the difference struck her at once.

The pressure gathered faster this time, heavier, as if the room had grown impatient with practice. She felt resistance where before there had been only compliance, like pressing against something that pressed back with equal force.

Stop—

The bead jerked mid-roll, then froze.

Too low.

It hung below the table's edge, suspended at an angle that made her eyes ache to follow.

Rachel's stomach turned over.

The air around the bead looked wrong—thin and cold, like something had carved out a hollow and forgotten to fill it back in. The space itself seemed wounded.

Ilyra straightened sharply. "Arathen."

"I see it."

Rachel's breath came shallow. "What did I—"

"You didn't do anything wrong," Maelin said, but the uncertainty in her voice undermined the reassurance.

Edrin stared at the empty space surrounding the bead, his face pale. "The displacement is visible."

"Rachel," Arathen said. His voice cut through without rising. "Stop."

She looked at him, confused. "It's already—"

"I'm not talking to the bead."

The words landed like cold water.

Rachel understood then. She was still holding on. Still gripping that nameless thing inside her chest, clenching it tight as if releasing it would tear something fundamental loose. The pressure built with nowhere to go, trapped and growing.

Arathen moved closer—not crowding, just positioning himself between her and the table, breaking her line of sight.

"Look at me," he said.

Rachel dragged her gaze away from the bead. Met his eyes.

Steady. Patient. Waiting.

"Breathe," he said.

She did. In through her nose. Out through her mouth. The way she'd learned in some forgotten wellness seminar, the kind of breathing that was supposed to fix things.

The pressure eased. Barely. Just enough.

The cold hollow around the bead softened at the edges.

"Good," Arathen said quietly. "Now let go."

Rachel released.

The bead fell. Hit the floor with a sound that felt muffled, wrong. It rolled slowly, as if moving through something thicker than air, before coming to rest against the table leg.

Rachel's pulse pounded in her temples.

Arathen watched the bead until it stopped completely. His expression gave nothing away.

"That was different," Rachel said. Her voice came out smaller than she'd intended.

"Yes."

Edrin looked like he wanted to speak. His mouth opened. Closed. He said nothing.

Ilyra's arms folded tight across her chest. "How much risk are we carrying?"

Arathen didn't answer immediately. He reached for his mug—a reflexive gesture—then seemed to realize it was empty and set it back down with care.

"For now," he said, "we proceed carefully. Nothing larger. Nothing more complex."

No one argued.

Rachel's attention drifted back to the bead where it rested against the table leg. Just wood. Smooth and ordinary and harmless.

She waited for the room to return to normal.

It didn't.

The air held its shape a moment too long, like breath caught and held, waiting for permission to resume. The building's hum continued beneath the floorboards, steady and patient.

Rachel curled her fingers into her palms and stayed very still.

She couldn't tell if the pressure she felt was fading.

Or gathering.
