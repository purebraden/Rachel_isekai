## Chapter Eleven

They didn’t leave right away.

Rachel had expected that part to happen quickly — a plan, a bag, a door opening — because that was how things usually went when people realized they were out of their depth. Instead, the morning stretched. The house settled back into itself, like it had decided they weren’t done yet.

Rachel sat on the floor near the table, back against one of the legs, knees pulled up. She didn’t remember choosing that spot. She just ended up there, listening to the scrape of chairs as Edrin moved them around again for reasons he didn’t explain.

Ilyra leaned in the doorway, counting something on her fingers and then starting over when she lost track. Maelin rinsed a cup that was already clean. Arathen stood near the window, looking out like the view might eventually answer him back.

No one spoke for a while.

Rachel realized she was waiting for someone to tell her what they’d decided.

That bothered her more than the silence.

“So,” she said finally. Her voice came out steadier than she felt. “Is this the part where someone tells me what happens next?”

Ilyra glanced at Arathen. Arathen didn’t look away from the window.

“We’re still figuring that out,” Maelin said gently.

Rachel nodded. “Okay. Because it feels like you’re all waiting for something.”

“We are,” Edrin said, then winced like he’d answered the wrong question.

Rachel tilted her head. “For what?”

Edrin hesitated. “For you to… settle.”

Rachel barked a laugh before she could stop herself. “That’s optimistic.”

Ilyra snorted. “He means stabilize. Not calm down.”

“That’s worse,” Rachel said.

Arathen finally turned. He studied her for a moment, eyes moving over her the way they had the bead the day before — not assessing her worth, just noticing what was happening now.

“You’re not wrong,” he said. “This isn’t sustainable.”

Rachel let that sit. “You mean me?”

“I mean the situation,” he said. “Which includes you.”

“Lucky me.”

Maelin crouched nearby, resting her arms on her knees. “We’re not planning to keep you here like this,” she said. “If that’s what you’re worried about.”

Rachel’s stomach tightened. “I wasn’t,” she said. Then, after a beat, “I mean. I am. But not just that.”

Maelin waited.

Rachel picked at a thread on her sleeve. It was starting to come loose. She tugged it once and then stopped herself.

“I keep feeling like I walked into the middle of something,” she said. “Like everyone else got a memo I missed.”

“That’s not untrue,” Ilyra said.

Rachel looked up. “Can you at least tell me what page we’re on?”

Edrin shifted, book forgotten on the table. “We were… trying something.”

Rachel blinked. “You were trying something.”

“Yes.”

She pushed herself upright, sitting cross-legged now, facing them. “Okay. Then maybe I should know what that something was.”

No one answered immediately.

The house hummed softly under her, like it was listening too.

Arathen broke the silence. “We don’t usually involve… unwilling participants.”

“That’s comforting,” Rachel said flatly.

He winced. “I said usually.”

She waited.

“We were trying to summon help,” Maelin said carefully.

Rachel frowned. “Help with what?”

“That,” Ilyra said, gesturing vaguely. “Is complicated.”

Rachel let out a slow breath. “Try me.”

Edrin rubbed at his temple. “There are things in this world that don’t stay where they’re supposed to. Forces that cross boundaries they shouldn’t. Most of the time, people adapt. Sometimes they can’t.”

Rachel listened, eyes flicking between them. “And you thought a demon would help.”

The word landed heavier than she expected.

Ilyra shrugged. “They’re good with boundaries.”

“That’s one way to put it,” Arathen said.

Rachel stared at the floor for a moment. Something inside her shifted, slow and uncomfortable.

“Who,” she asked, “were you trying to get?”

Edrin opened his mouth.

Arathen raised a hand, not sharply, just enough.

“We can talk about that,” he said. “But not all at once.”

Rachel looked at him. “Why?”

“Because you’re already carrying enough.”

She laughed again, softer this time. “You don’t get to decide that.”

Arathen met her gaze. “No,” he said. “But I do get to notice when someone’s balance is already off.”

Rachel pressed her palms into the floor, grounding herself in the solid, ordinary pressure of it.

“Did you know it might not work?” she asked.

“Yes,” Edrin said immediately.

“Did you know it might get someone else?”

Silence.

That answer landed on its own.

Rachel nodded slowly. “Okay.”

The word didn’t mean forgiveness. It didn’t mean understanding. It just meant she’d reached the end of what she could hold without something breaking.

“But you still haven’t told me,” she said, quieter now, “why this is happening to me.”

No one answered.

Rachel felt her chest tighten. “I didn’t have powers before,” she said. “I didn’t feel—” She stopped, pressing her fingers into the floor. “I didn’t feel like this.”

Maelin shifted closer. “Rachel—”

“No,” Rachel said, sharper than she meant to. “I need to understand this part.”

She looked at Arathen. “You keep looking at me like you already know.”

Arathen closed his eyes briefly. When he opened them again, his voice had lost its casual edge.

“I don’t know,” he said. “Not completely.”

Rachel’s throat tightened. “Try.”

He stepped away from the window. He didn’t pace. He didn’t sit. He stood where she could see him.

“Magic doesn’t behave the same way in all worlds,” he said slowly. “Some places are thin. Others are dense. Here, it presses back.”

Rachel swallowed. “So?”

“So most people who cross over feel it as resistance. Fatigue. Disorientation.”

“And me?”

Arathen met her eyes. “You feel it as recognition.”

The room seemed to tilt.

Rachel laughed, short and breathless. “That’s not a thing.”

“It is,” he said. “It’s just not common.”

She shook her head. “You’re saying this place is giving me something.”

“I’m saying,” Arathen corrected, “it’s allowing something.”

Rachel’s hands curled into fists. “Allowing what?”

He hesitated.

“That part,” he said carefully, “was already yours.”

The words landed like a dropped plate.

“So what,” Rachel said. “I was just… dormant?”

“That’s one word for it,” Edrin said quietly.

Rachel shot him a look. “Did you know?”

He shook his head immediately. “No. But it explains the summoning misfire.”

“Misfire,” Rachel repeated. “You make it sound like a machine.”

“That’s how people talk,” Ilyra said, “when they’re trying not to say mistake.”

Rachel stood abruptly, pacing two steps before stopping herself. The room felt smaller now, tighter in a way that had nothing to do with magic.

“So you’re telling me,” she said, “that my body was just waiting for the right atmosphere.”

“That’s not—” Maelin began.

“It is,” Rachel said. “I didn’t wake up with this. I changed.”

Her voice wavered despite her effort to keep it steady.

Arathen watched her carefully. “You didn’t change,” he said. “You became possible.”

Rachel pressed her palms against her eyes, breathing hard. “I don’t like that,” she said. “I don’t like any of this.”

“I know,” Arathen said.

“And you think I should just learn to live with it?”

“No,” he said. “I think you should meet someone who already has.”

Rachel lowered her hands slowly.

“Someone like me,” she said.

“Someone close enough,” he replied.

The house creaked softly, like it was settling around the decision.

Rachel closed her eyes for a second.

When she opened them, the world felt the same.

Which meant it wouldn’t stay that way.
