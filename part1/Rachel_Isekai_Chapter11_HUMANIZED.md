## Chapter Eleven

They didn't leave right away.

Rachel had expected urgency—a plan formed quickly, bags packed, the door closing behind them before the morning finished settling. That was how things worked when people realized they'd miscalculated. But the hours stretched instead, time moving without purpose or direction. The house breathed around them, patient and watchful, as if it had decided they weren't finished yet.

Rachel sat on the floor near the table, back pressed against one of the legs, knees drawn up. She hadn't chosen the spot consciously. It had simply become where she was, listening to the scrape of chair legs as Edrin rearranged furniture for reasons he didn't articulate. Small movements. Adjustments that might have meant something or nothing.

Ilyra stood in the doorway, arms folded, gaze distant. Counting something internal—breaths or heartbeats or decisions. Maelin moved through the space washing things that were already clean, hands occupied with purpose where her mind couldn't settle. Arathen remained at the window, attention fixed on the clearing beyond as if waiting for the landscape to offer answers.

No one spoke.

The silence pressed in from all sides, thick with unspoken decisions.

Rachel realized she was waiting for someone to tell her what they'd concluded. What verdict they'd reached about her. About what came next.

The realization bothered her more than the quiet did.

"Is this the part," she said finally, voice steadier than she felt, "where someone explains what happens now?"

Ilyra glanced toward Arathen. He didn't turn from the window.

"We're still deciding," Maelin said. Her tone stayed gentle, careful.

Rachel's jaw tightened. "You're waiting for something."

Edrin stopped moving chairs. "We are," he said, then flinched as if he'd spoken out of turn.

"For what?" Rachel asked.

He hesitated, fingers curling against the chair back. "For you to… stabilize."

The word sat wrong in her mouth. Rachel wanted to laugh—felt the impulse rise sharp and bitter—but swallowed it instead. "I don't think that's happening."

Ilyra's expression stayed flat. "He means the magic. Not you."

"That doesn't help," Rachel said.

Arathen finally turned from the window. His gaze settled on Rachel with that same careful attention he'd given the bead—measuring not her worth, but what existed in this moment.

"You're right," he said. "This isn't sustainable."

Rachel's chest tightened. "You mean me."

"I mean the situation," he said. "Which includes you, but isn't only you."

Rachel didn't answer. The distinction felt thin.

Maelin moved closer and crouched nearby, arms resting on her knees. "We're not keeping you here," she said quietly. "Not like this. Not indefinitely."

"But you haven't decided what you are doing," Rachel said.

Maelin's silence confirmed it.

Rachel found a loose thread on her borrowed sleeve. Pulled it once. Stopped herself before she unraveled more. "I keep feeling like I walked into the middle of a conversation," she said. "Like you all know the context and I'm just guessing."

"That's not inaccurate," Ilyra said.

Rachel looked up at her. "Then tell me what I'm missing."

Edrin shifted uncomfortably, his book forgotten on the table behind him. "We were attempting something. A summoning."

"I know that part," Rachel said.

"You don't know why," he said.

She pushed herself upright, folding her legs beneath her, facing them properly now. "Then maybe you should tell me."

The room held its breath. Even the building's hum seemed to quiet, as if waiting.

Arathen spoke first. "We don't typically involve unwilling participants."

Rachel's jaw tightened. "And yet."

He acknowledged that with a slight nod. "And yet."

"We needed help," Maelin said. Her hands folded together, fingers interlacing and releasing in small, repetitive movements. "With something we didn't know how to handle alone."

Rachel frowned. "Help with what?"

Ilyra's expression stayed flat. "That's where it gets complicated."

"Try me," Rachel said.

Edrin rubbed at his temple, fingers pressing hard enough to leave marks. "There are forces in this world that cross boundaries they shouldn't. Things that slip between spaces, that disrupt the way places hold together. Most people adapt. Build around them. But sometimes…"

"Sometimes adaptation isn't enough," Arathen finished.

Rachel watched them carefully. "So you tried to summon something to fix it."

"Someone," Maelin corrected quietly. "Not something."

The distinction landed cold in Rachel's chest. "You were summoning a demon."

The word fell heavy into the silence.

No one denied it.

Ilyra's arms remained folded. "They understand boundaries better than most."

Rachel stared at the floor, at the grain of the wood, at anything but the people watching her process this. Something shifted inside her—not quite fear, not quite anger. Something older and less defined.

"Who were you trying to reach?" she asked.

Edrin started to speak.

Arathen raised one hand—barely a movement, just enough to stop him.

"We can discuss that," Arathen said. "But not all at once. Not today."

Rachel's gaze snapped to him. "Why not?"

"Because you're already holding too much," he said. "And I won't add more until I'm certain you can carry it."

"That's not your decision," Rachel said.

"No," Arathen agreed. "But I can choose when I'm part of the adding."

Rachel pressed her palms flat against the floor, seeking stability in the solid, unchanging pressure of wood and stone.

"Did you know the summoning might fail?" she asked.

"Yes," Edrin said without hesitation.

"Did you know it might bring someone else? Someone who wasn't what you wanted?"

Silence answered her.

The absence of denial settled heavier than words could have.

Rachel nodded slowly. "All right."

The acknowledgment didn't carry forgiveness. Didn't carry understanding. It simply marked the limit of what she could process before something inside her fractured.

"But you still haven't told me," she said, voice dropping lower, "why this is happening to me specifically."

No one spoke.

Rachel's chest constricted. "I didn't have this before. I didn't feel—" She stopped, fingers curling against the floorboards. "I wasn't like this."

Maelin started to move closer. "Rachel—"

"No," Rachel said. The word came out harder than she'd intended. "I need to understand this part. I need to know why."

Her gaze fixed on Arathen. "You keep looking at me like you've already figured it out."

Arathen's eyes closed briefly. When they opened again, his expression had lost its measured calm, revealing something rawer beneath.

"I don't know everything," he said. "I wish I did."

Rachel's throat closed. "Then tell me what you do know."

He stepped away from the window. Didn't sit. Didn't move closer. Just positioned himself where she could see him clearly.

"Magic doesn't manifest uniformly across worlds," he said. Each word came carefully, precisely. "Some places hold it loosely. Others compress it until it becomes dense, resistant. This world pushes back against those who don't belong."

Rachel swallowed. "Meaning?"

"Meaning most people who cross from your world to this one experience it as obstruction. Exhaustion. A constant sense of being pushed away by something they can't see."

"But not me," Rachel said.

Arathen held her gaze. "You experience it as recognition."

The room shifted around her—or perhaps she shifted and the room stayed still. Rachel couldn't tell which.

She wanted to laugh. Felt the impulse rise bitter and sharp in her throat. "That's not possible."

"It's uncommon," he said. "Not impossible."

"You're saying this world gave me something."

"I'm saying," Arathen corrected quietly, "this world allowed something that was already there."

Rachel's hands formed fists against her thighs. "Allowed what?"

He hesitated. The pause stretched long enough to hurt.

"Something that belonged to you," he said finally. "Something that had no room to exist in your world."

The words hit like falling from a height she hadn't known she'd climbed.

"So I was broken there," Rachel said. "And I'm fixed here."

"You weren't broken," Edrin said, voice tight. "You were constrained."

Rachel looked at him. "Did you know that when you summoned me?"

"No," he said. "But it explains why the working reached you instead of what we'd called for."

"Misfire," Rachel said flatly.

Ilyra's expression stayed hard. "That's what people call it when they don't want to say they made a mistake they can't fix."

Rachel stood. The motion felt too abrupt, too uncontrolled. She took two steps and stopped, awareness that the room had no space for pacing.

"You're telling me," she said, "that my body was just waiting. That I came here and suddenly I could do things I was never supposed to be able to do."

"It's not that simple—" Maelin started.

"It is exactly that simple," Rachel said. Her voice cracked despite her effort to keep it level. "I wasn't this person yesterday. I am now. That's a change."

Arathen's gaze didn't waver. "You didn't change. You became congruent."

Rachel pressed both palms against her eyes, breathing too fast, too shallow. "I hate that," she said. "I hate all of this."

"I know," Arathen said.

"And you want me to just accept it? Learn to live with it?"

"No," he said. "I want you to meet someone who's already learned. Someone who can show you that it's survivable."

Rachel lowered her hands slowly.

"Someone like me," she said.

"Close enough," he replied.

The house settled around them with a sound like held breath released.

Rachel closed her eyes. Counted to three. Opened them again.

The world remained unchanged.

Which meant it was about to change completely.
