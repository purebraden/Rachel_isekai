## Chapter Twelve

They left later than planned.

Rachel had anticipated a clean departure—a moment when they'd close the door behind them and step deliberately onto the road. Instead, it happened gradually, in fragments. Someone returned for forgotten supplies. Someone else debated the sun's position and what that meant for their timing. By the time they actually left, the departure felt less like a decision and more like an inevitable drift.

The road stretched narrow before them—packed earth worn smooth by years of passage, edges blurred where grass encroached. It looked more like a suggestion than a definitive path, as if the land hadn't fully committed to the idea of roads.

Rachel adjusted her pack for the third time in as many minutes. The straps sat wrong no matter how she positioned them, weight pulling at her shoulders in ways her body didn't know how to accommodate.

"Stop adjusting," Ilyra said without looking back, but her tone was gentle. "You're making it worse."

Rachel's hands stilled. "It doesn't fit right."

"It won't," Ilyra said. "Not for days. Your body needs to learn the weight."

Rachel left the straps alone, though every instinct screamed to keep trying to fix it. The weight settled into an ache that started immediate and promised to grow worse.

Maelin fell back until she walked beside Rachel. "The first day is the hardest," she said sympathetically. "Your body doesn't know what you're asking it to do yet."

"When does it get easier?" Rachel asked, trying not to sound as pathetic as she felt.

"Eventually," Maelin said, which was kinder than honesty required. "You get stronger. Your shoulders stop screaming. You learn how to walk differently."

"How long is eventually?"

Maelin's smile held sympathy. "Sooner than you think when you're in it. You're tougher than you know."

Rachel wanted to believe that.

They walked in loose formation, each person settling into a natural position. Ilyra moved ahead, attention scanning the road with the learned focus of someone who knew which details mattered and which could be ignored. Edrin followed several paces back, consulting the map periodically before looking up to confirm what he'd read against what he saw. Arathen drifted—sometimes beside Rachel, sometimes behind, his position shifting without apparent pattern.

The forest beside the road demanded attention in ways Earth forests never had. The trees grew wrong—bark spiraling counterclockwise in tight helixes, branches splitting at angles that seemed structurally impossible. Some trunks were translucent enough to show the fluid moving inside them, sap that glowed faintly amber. The leaves were too blue, veins pressing so close to the surface they looked embossed, and they rustled with a sound like chimes rather than paper.

Something moved through the canopy above them—not quite bird, not quite mammal. Rachel caught glimpses: six legs, wings that seemed to be made of membrane stretched between finger-like bones, a tail that ended in a tuft of something that might have been feathers or might have been something else entirely. It called out—a sound that started as birdsong and fractured into something crystalline, notes that didn't quite resolve.

Flowers grew in clusters along the roadside, their petals arranged in perfect spirals that made Rachel's eyes want to follow the pattern inward. They were red, but red like Rachel had never seen—red that seemed to contain other colors trying to escape. When the wind moved through them, they released pollen that caught the light and hung suspended for too long, drifting in patterns that defied physics.

"Don't touch those," Maelin warned, noticing Rachel's attention. "The spiral blooms. Their pollen can disorient you if you get too close."

Rachel pulled her gaze away with effort. "Everything here is so... deliberate. Like it was designed instead of evolved."

"Different rules," Arathen said from beside her. "Evolution here responds to magic as much as natural selection. Things grow toward power, not just sunlight."

Rachel's feet found rhythm in the uneven ground. Her shoulders ached under the pack's weight. Sweat gathered at the small of her back.

It was the most physically present she'd felt in years.

Back home, she'd driven the same route to work every day, mind already at her desk before her body arrived. She'd moved through a world of climate control and ergonomic chairs, of careful distance from discomfort. Her body had been transportation for her mind, nothing more.

Here, every step registered. Every breath counted. She was aware of her body in a way that should have been exhausting but instead felt like finally inhabiting herself.

The Near March didn't announce its proximity.

Rachel had expected something visible—a boundary marker, a shift in vegetation, some clear indication that they'd entered a different region. Instead, awareness crept in gradually. The air grew denser, not oppressive but present in a way it hadn't been before. Sound behaved differently here. A birdcall began and faded too quickly, cut short as if the air itself had absorbed it. Their footsteps seemed to vanish before the sound could travel.

Rachel's frown deepened. "Something's different here."

Ilyra glanced back over her shoulder. "Different how?"

"The air," Rachel said, pressing a hand to her chest. "It's heavier. Like it's—watching? No, that's not right. It's waiting for something."

Edrin's attention snapped to her immediately, and he looked almost excited. "You're sensing the boundary? Already?"

"I think so," Rachel said uncertainly.

Arathen adjusted his pace until he walked between them, his expression thoughtful. "That's the March's edge. Most people don't notice it until they're standing right at the threshold."

Rachel's unease deepened. "Should I be able to feel it from this far away?"

"It means you're sensitive to the boundaries," Arathen said. "Which is useful, even if it's uncomfortable."

"We should trust her instincts," Maelin said from behind them. "If it feels wrong to her, it probably is wrong."

They didn't move any nearer to it. Edrin consulted the map more frequently, muttering about boundary shifts and stability gradients. Then Rachel stopped walking and pointed to their left.

"That direction," she said. "The pressure is lower there. Safer."

Edrin looked up from the map, frowning. "The marked route continues right."

"I know what the map says," Rachel said. "But the road to the right—it feels wrong. Unstable. Like walking on ice that's starting to thin."

Ilyra studied the terrain in both directions. "The left looks rougher. More overgrown."

"It is," Rachel said. "But it's solid. The other way..." She shook her head. "Something's wrong with it."

"That's good enough for me," Ilyra said, and turned left without hesitation.

The others followed, and the pressure eased almost immediately, like stepping out of a room where the air had grown too close.

Edrin stared at the map, then looked up, then back down. "It changed," he said quietly, something like awe in his voice. "The route just updated to match what Rachel sensed."

"The map knows when someone who can actually read it is present," Arathen said, a hint of a smile in his voice. "It's showing her the truth instead of the approximation."

Rachel focused on walking after that, letting the praise settle warm in her chest. They trusted her. That mattered more than she'd expected.

After an hour, her legs burned.

After two, her shoulders ached.

She didn’t complain. Mostly because everyone else looked like this was normal.

They stopped when Maelin said they should, not because anyone argued. Packs came off. Water was shared. Rachel drank more than she meant to and immediately regretted it.

“So,” she said, wiping her mouth. “How far did we go?”

Edrin checked the map. “Less than we planned.”

“Of course.”

“But farther than we would have if we’d taken the other bend,” he added.

Rachel nodded, strangely pleased.

They ate something small and unremarkable. Rachel couldn't tell if it was meant to taste that bland or if her mouth was just tired.

Arathen stood and brushed crumbs from his hands. "Rachel, while we have a moment."

She looked up at him, already knowing what he meant. Her stomach tightened.

"Just something small," he said. "To keep the sensation familiar."

Rachel set down her water and stood, legs protesting. The others gave them space without being asked, drifting to the edges of their rest area. Creating a buffer zone.

In case something went wrong.

Arathen picked up a small stone from the roadside. "Stop this before it hits the ground. Like the bead."

He tossed it gently.

Rachel's hand came up instinctively. She focused on the warmth, the memory of control, the clean catch of breath she'd felt when it worked before.

The stone slowed.

Not stopped—not suspended in mid-air like the bead had been—but it drifted down like it was falling through honey instead of air, giving her time to catch it in her palm.

The warmth in her hand flared briefly, then faded.

"Good," Arathen said, and he sounded genuinely pleased. "That's progress. You're not fighting it anymore."

"It felt easier," Rachel admitted, surprised. "Less... stuck."

"Because you're not panicking," he said. "Fear makes it pool instead of flow. The more you practice in calm moments, the better you'll handle urgent ones."

Rachel turned the stone over in her hand. It was just a rock. Ordinary. But she'd changed how it fell, bent the rules of gravity around it, and it had felt almost... natural.

That should have been terrifying.

It was. But it was also starting to feel like hers.

"Again?" Arathen asked.

Rachel nodded.

They practiced three more times before Ilyra called that they needed to move. Each time, the warmth came quicker, the control smoother. By the last one, Rachel caught the stone mid-air and held it there for a breath before letting it drop into her hand.

Then something changed.

Rachel felt it like pressure against her awareness—not physical, but present. The sensation of being watched, but not with eyes. Someone was observing her through boundaries, their attention brushing against her like fingertips through fabric.

She froze, the stone dropping from her hand.

"What's wrong?" Arathen asked immediately.

"Someone's watching," Rachel said quietly. She turned slowly, trying to locate the source. "Not here. Through boundaries. I can feel them."

Arathen went very still. His own awareness extended outward, searching. After a moment, his expression darkened. "I don't sense anything."

"They're there," Rachel insisted. The presence lingered at the edge of her perception—curious, assessing, not hostile but definitely intentional. "They're... far away. Not physically close. But watching through boundary space somehow."

"That's advanced technique," Arathen said quietly. "Remote observation. Most demons can't do it at distance." He looked at Rachel with concern. "The fact that you can sense it when I can't—that's significant."

"Is it dangerous?" Maelin asked, hand moving toward her pack.

"Not immediately," Arathen said. "But it means someone knows about Rachel. Someone powerful enough to track her across boundary regions." He paused. "And skilled enough to hide from me while doing it."

The presence withdrew suddenly, like a door closing. Rachel felt its absence as clearly as she'd felt its arrival.

"They're gone," she said.

"But they found you," Ilyra said grimly. "And they'll be back."

Arathen's jaw was tight. "We need to move faster. If someone's tracking Rachel, they might not be content with just watching."

As they shouldered their packs and continued walking, Rachel's mind churned. "Wait," she said, stopping. "What exactly are boundaries? I keep sensing them, crossing them, being watched through them—but I don't actually know what they are."

Arathen turned back, something shifting in his expression. Not surprise—more like he'd been waiting for this question.

"Boundaries are where different states of reality meet," he said. "Where the rules of one world press against the rules of another. Think of reality as layers—your world is one layer, this world is another, and there are countless others. Boundaries are the spaces between those layers."

"Like walls?" Rachel asked.

"More like membranes," Edrin said, coming closer. "Walls are solid, rigid. Boundaries are flexible. They can be thin or thick, stable or unstable. They keep worlds separate, but they also allow for... permeability. Under the right conditions."

Arathen continued. "The March is a region where boundaries have become unstable—too many realities pressing against each other, creating fractures. That's why it's dangerous. You could step into a thin place and fall through into somewhere else entirely."

"But some people can manipulate boundaries," Rachel said slowly. "Like demons. Like me."

"Like you," Arathen confirmed. "Boundary walkers don't just sense where realities meet—they can affect them. Strengthen thin places. Weaken thick ones. Cross between worlds intentionally. What you do with time and space? That's boundary manipulation. You're bending the rules of this reality because you can access the spaces where rules are flexible."

Rachel processed that. "So when I pause time—"

"You're not actually stopping time," Edrin said, excitement creeping into his voice. "You're creating a localized boundary around the object where time flows differently. A pocket where your rules override the world's rules."

"And when someone watches me through boundaries—"

"They're extending their awareness across those spaces between worlds," Arathen said. "Using the boundaries as... pathways. Connections. It takes significant power and skill."

The explanation settled heavy in Rachel's chest. She wasn't just doing magic. She was manipulating the fabric of reality itself. The spaces between worlds.

"That's terrifying," she said.

"Yes," Arathen agreed. "But it's also what you are."

As they shouldered their packs and continued walking, Rachel felt different. Not confident—she wasn't that foolish—but less afraid of what lived inside her.

And more afraid of whoever was interested in it.

The watcher's presence had felt analytical. Clinical. Like she was a specimen being studied.

She didn't like it at all.

As they walked again, the world opened up in small ways. Rachel's attention snagged on details she was only beginning to recognize as significant.

A creature the size of a housecat darted across the path—four-legged like Earth mammals, but with a second set of smaller limbs tucked against its chest. Its fur was iridescent, shifting between blue and copper depending on how the light caught it. It paused to study them with eyes that had horizontal pupils, then vanished into the undergrowth with unsettling speed.

The undergrowth itself was thick with ferns that weren't quite ferns—fronds that moved when nothing touched them, curling inward whenever shadows passed overhead. Among them grew clusters of fungi in impossible colors: violet that glowed faintly in shade, orange that seemed to pulse with its own internal light. Edrin noticed Rachel staring and said quietly, "Don't eat anything without asking first. Half the plants here are toxic to humans."

"Are they toxic to me?" Rachel asked.

"Unclear," Edrin admitted. "We're still learning what rules apply to you."

A farmhouse appeared set back from the road, its walls made of that same living wood Rachel had noticed in the settlement—grown rather than built, shaped by magic into shelter. Smoke rose from a chimney that spiraled up into the canopy. In the field beside it, something that might have been cattle grazed, though they had too many legs and their heads were the wrong shape, elongated and crowned with what looked like bone ridges rather than horns.

A pair of travelers passed heading the opposite direction—human, or human enough, with packs like theirs and the weathered look of people who spent their lives on roads. They nodded without stopping, but Rachel caught one of them glancing at her with something that might have been recognition or might have been curiosity.

Someone's laughter drifted from somewhere Rachel couldn't see, high and bright, followed by a child's voice speaking in a language that sounded almost familiar but resolved into nothing she could understand.

This wasn't wilderness.

That unsettled her more than she expected. She'd been thinking of this world as fantasy, as something separate from ordinary life. But people lived here. Farmed here. Raised children and traveled roads and laughed at jokes she'd never understand.

It was real. Not a dream or a temporary displacement. Real.

By late afternoon, the pack's weight had become nearly unbearable. Rachel's shoulders burned with each step, the straps cutting into muscle that hadn't known this kind of sustained strain existed. She was calculating how to ask for a rest without revealing how badly she needed one when Ilyra slowed.

"We stop here," she said.

Relief flooded through Rachel so intensely it felt almost like pain.

As they left the road, a thought struck her with unexpected force: What day was it?

She tried to count back. The summoning had been—what, Wednesday? Thursday? She'd lost track somewhere between the second test with Arathen and the packing. How many days had it been? A week? More?

Back home, Evan would have filed a missing person report by now. Would have called everyone she knew. Her parents would be frantic. Mara would be organizing search parties. Her coworkers would be whispering theories.

And here she was, walking down a dirt road in another world, more concerned about whether her pack straps were adjusted correctly than about the people who loved her tearing themselves apart with worry.

How long had it been for them? With time moving differently between worlds, they could have been searching for weeks. Months. They might have already held a memorial service for her.

The guilt hit hard enough to steal her breath.

And underneath it, worse than the guilt—the knowledge that even if they found a way to send her back tomorrow, the resonance had already grown so strong she wasn't sure she could leave. The connection deepened with every step she took in this world. Every meal shared. Every moment of magic used.

The timer wasn't just ticking anymore. It might have already run out.

They left the road, moving into a shallow grove of trees that offered cover without feeling enclosed. The trees here were different from the roadside forest—shorter, with bark that had a smooth, almost waxy texture. Their leaves grew in clusters that rotated slowly throughout the day, following the sun's path. The ground beneath them was carpeted with something that looked like moss but felt springier, more resilient, like walking on living memory foam.

Small flying insects drifted through the air—not quite fireflies, but similar. They pulsed with bioluminescence in patterns that seemed almost communicative: two quick flashes, a pause, three slow pulses. A whole conversation Rachel couldn't read. They avoided the group carefully, maintaining a consistent distance as if proximity to humans was something they'd learned to judge precisely.

In the branches overhead, something chirped—high and sustained, more like a frog than a bird. Another answered from farther away, and then another, until the grove filled with a chorus of overlapping calls that rose and fell in waves.

Maelin crouched to examine the earth, pressing her palm flat against it. "This will do."

Edrin began unstrapping his pack, movements economical despite his obvious fatigue.

Rachel let her pack slide from her shoulders with a groan she couldn't quite suppress. The sudden absence of weight made her feel unbalanced, as if she might float away without it anchoring her. She stretched carefully, wincing as her spine protested.

"I don't see anywhere to shelter," she said, looking around the grove. "Are we sleeping under the stars?"

"Not quite," Ilyra said, already unpacking. "Watch."

She pulled out what looked like ordinary canvas—aged and folded small, unremarkable in every visible way. Rachel watched as Ilyra and Maelin began setting it up with practiced efficiency, poles appearing and clicking into place with motions too quick to follow. The structure that emerged looked impossibly small.

Rachel stared at it. "Please tell me that's not for all five of us."

"It's bigger than it looks," Maelin said with a small smile.

Rachel circled it once, trying to make the dimensions work in her mind. They didn't. "I don't understand. There's no way we all fit in there."

"Magic is strange about space sometimes," Arathen said, watching her process this. "The inside doesn't always match the outside."

Rachel stopped walking. Looked at him. Looked back at the tent. "That's..."

"Impossible?" Maelin suggested gently.

"I was going to say terrifying," Rachel admitted.

"It's safe," Maelin assured her. "I've slept in this tent hundreds of times. It's actually more stable than most buildings."

Rachel moved closer, then hesitated at the threshold. Through the opening, she could see light that shouldn't exist, space that shouldn't fit.

"Take your time," Arathen said. "It's disorienting the first time."

Rachel took a breath and stepped through.

The interior unfolded around her—not gradually, but all at once, as if space itself had been waiting for her to accept the invitation. A central room opened before her, far larger than the exterior could contain. Walls hung with fabric that somehow felt permanent. A low table. Shelves already stocked with supplies. Doorways suggesting other rooms beyond.

"Oh," Rachel breathed out. "Oh, this is—"

"Impossible?" Ilyra said, stepping in behind her. "Yeah. But useful."

Rachel took a few steps inside, touching the wall to confirm it was solid. "How does this work?"

"Very old magic," Edrin said, entering last and setting his pack down with a thump. "Folded space. Most people can't make these anymore."

"This is incredible," Rachel said, and found she meant it. The terror had given way to wonder. "I mean, it still violates everything I thought I knew about physics, but it's incredible."

Maelin smiled at that, pleased. "I'm glad you like it. You'll have your own space—there's a small room in the back that's quiet."

The thoughtfulness of that—of making sure Rachel had privacy—struck her unexpectedly hard.

"Thank you," she said, and her voice came out softer than she'd intended. "All of you. For—" She gestured vaguely. "For not leaving me behind. For including me."

"You're one of us now," Ilyra said matter-of-factly. "Where else would you be?"

Rachel's throat tightened. She dropped her pack and let herself lean against the wall, suddenly aware of how exhausted she was—not just physically, but emotionally.

Maelin's hand found her shoulder. "First day is done. You did it."

"We did it," Rachel corrected quietly.

Maelin squeezed gently. "Yes. We did."

Outside, light began to fade between the trees, shadows lengthening across ground they'd covered. Inside, the tent maintained its impossible steady presence, indifferent to the progression of time beyond its walls.

Rachel found a bench and sat, letting the exhaustion finally settle fully into her bones. Her body catalogued the day's damage—blisters forming, muscles strained past familiar limits, a headache building behind her eyes from concentration and sun.

Around her, the others moved through their evening routines with practiced efficiency. Edrin sorted through his pack, checking that nothing had shifted wrong. Ilyra examined her boots for damage. Maelin began unpacking what they'd need for the night.

Normal actions. Ordinary preparations.

Except nothing about this was ordinary.

Rachel looked around the impossible space—walls that shouldn't exist, light from nowhere, people who'd become something like family in less than a week.

"Get some sleep," Ilyra said, already settling into her own space. "Tomorrow's another long day."

Rachel nodded and lay back, staring at the curved ceiling.

Outside, the road waited. Inside, her eyes stayed open.
