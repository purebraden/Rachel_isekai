## Chapter Twelve

Packing was not a simple matter.

Rachel had expected efficiency—decisions made quickly, belongings sorted into clear categories of necessary and dispensable. Instead, the morning unfolded in careful negotiations and silent reconsiderations, each person moving through their own internal calculus of what could be carried and what had to be left behind.

Edrin had taken over the table immediately. Books spread before him in stacks that grew and shrank as he reconsidered their necessity. His hands moved between volumes with a kind of restless precision, fingers tracing spines as if touch could determine essential from merely useful.

"You can't carry all of those," Ilyra said. Her tone stayed level, factual.

Edrin's jaw tightened. "These are reference texts."

"Choose three," she said.

"That's not sufficient—"

"Then choose five," Ilyra said. "But you're carrying them yourself, and we're walking."

Edrin stared at the books as if the weight of the decision matched the weight of the volumes. Finally, reluctantly, he moved one thick tome from the keep pile to the discard pile. The motion looked like it cost him something.

Rachel watched from the floor near the far wall, legs folded beneath her, hands empty. She'd been sitting there long enough that the position had grown uncomfortable, but standing felt like drawing attention she didn't want.

She had nothing to pack.

The realization had arrived gradually, accumulating in small observations—the others sorting through belongings, making choices, while she sat with nothing to sort, nothing to choose. Everything that had defined her previous existence had vanished with the car. Phone. Wallet. Keys. The accumulated proof of identity, all gone.

She looked down at her borrowed clothes. Even these didn't belong to her.

"Rachel."

Maelin's voice drew her attention. Maelin stood with a bundle of fabric in her arms, expression careful.

"These should fit," Maelin said, crossing to where Rachel sat. "They're not much, but they're practical for travel."

Rachel accepted the clothes without speaking. The weight settled in her lap, solid and real.

"I don't have anything to carry them in," she said quietly.

Arathen straightened from where he'd been leaning against the wall. "That's an oversight on our part."

Ilyra appeared with a worn pack and set it beside Rachel without comment. "You'll need this."

Rachel stared at it for a moment before tucking the clothes inside. The simple act of having something to put away, somewhere to put it, steadied her more than she'd expected. She folded each piece with more care than necessary, attention fixed on the ordinary task.

"Shoes," Ilyra said, looking at Rachel's feet. "Those won't last a day on the road."

Rachel looked down at her work flats, still somehow intact despite everything that had happened. They belonged to a different life. A different person. "I know."

"We'll find something in the first town," Ilyra said. "It can't wait longer than that."

Rachel nodded.

Arathen moved to the table and began unwrapping something from protective cloth. The fabric fell away to reveal a map—not paper, but something that looked aged and preserved, surface marked with lines that seemed to shift as the light changed angle.

"This guides us," he said.

Edrin straightened, attention immediately focused. "You're bringing that."

"Yes."

"That's—" He stopped himself, then continued more carefully. "That's not commonly traveled with."

"No," Arathen agreed. "It isn't."

The map spread across the table as Arathen weighted the corners. Lines emerged slowly, as if the surface needed time to remember what it was meant to show. Rachel found herself drawn closer, pulled by something she couldn't name.

The symbols resolved into clarity as she looked at them—not gradually, but all at once, as if they'd been waiting for her attention specifically.

She frowned.

"That route is broken," she said, pointing to a line that curved through the eastern section.

Edrin moved beside her, following her gesture. "It's marked as continuous."

"It's not," Rachel said. "Not anymore. It's—" She searched for the word. "Interrupted. Like something pulled it apart."

Ilyra leaned in to look. "That passes near the Near March."

Rachel glanced up at her. "I still don't know what that means."

Maelin's hands folded together at her waist. "It's a place where boundaries grow thin. Where things don't settle properly. The land changes. Roads appear and disappear."

"Dangerous," Rachel said.

"Sometimes," Maelin said. "Always unpredictable."

Rachel looked back at the map. The Near March showed as a kind of blur, lines refusing to hold their definition near its borders.

"We're not going through it," she said. Not a question.

"No," Arathen confirmed. "But we travel along its edge."

Rachel's stomach tightened. She'd expected him to say they'd avoid it entirely.

Edrin studied the map more closely. "How are you reading the layers?"

Rachel looked at him. "Layers?"

"The map shows multiple routes depending on conditions," he said. "They overlap. It usually takes time to distinguish them."

She looked back at the map. To her eyes, the routes appeared clear, distinct. "It doesn't look layered to me."

Arathen's attention remained on her rather than the map. "You see it clearly."

"I suppose," Rachel said. The ease with which she'd read it unsettled her.

"That's not common," Edrin said quietly.

Rachel didn't respond. She couldn't.

They returned to their preparations after that—quieter, more deliberate. Edrin made his final selections, each book placed in his pack with visible reluctance for those left behind. Ilyra checked straps and weight distribution with practiced efficiency. Maelin wrapped something in cloth and tucked it carefully into the bottom of her pack where it wouldn't shift.

Rachel watched them work, then looked down at her own pack. One borrowed set of clothes. No personal objects. No accumulated history. Everything that had marked her as herself—photos, documents, small objects carried more for sentiment than function—all of it gone.

She should have felt lighter.

Instead, the absence weighed more than possessions ever had.

The afternoon sun angled lower through the windows, casting long shadows across the floor. They weren't ready yet—wouldn't be ready for hours still—but the shape of departure had formed. The building seemed to sense it too. Its hum had changed subtly, shifted to something that felt less like observation and more like anticipation.

Rachel closed her pack and set it beside the others.

Not hers. But hers to carry.

For the first time since arriving, she could see the outline of what came next—not clearly, not completely, but enough to know they were moving toward it whether she felt prepared or not.
