## Chapter Twelve

Packing turned out to be a conversation.

Not the efficient kind. The kind where someone asks a question, someone else answers a different one, and everyone slowly realizes they’re talking about three separate problems.

Edrin had claimed the table almost immediately, stacking books in uneven piles that leaned toward one another like they were conspiring. He kept adjusting the stacks, shifting one volume from left to right and then back again, as if the order mattered more than the total weight.

“You’re not bringing all of those,” Ilyra said flatly.

“I need them,” Edrin replied without looking up.

“You need *some* of them,” she corrected. “You want all of them.”

Edrin frowned at the pile nearest him. “This one is irreplaceable.”

Maelin leaned over his shoulder. “You said that about the last three.”

“They are.”

“Edrin,” Ilyra said, patient in the way that meant she wasn’t. “We’re walking.”

“I know that.”

“With packs.”

“I’m aware.”

“On roads that aren’t stable.”

Edrin hesitated, fingers resting on the spine of a thick, cracked volume. He sighed and slid it into the *no* pile with visible reluctance.

Rachel watched all of this from the edge of the room, sitting cross-legged on the floor with absolutely nothing in front of her.

That was… new.

She glanced around, half-expecting to find a bag she’d forgotten about. There wasn’t one. No pile. No stack. No quiet accumulation of objects that meant *this is mine*.

She swallowed.

“So,” she said casually, a little too casually. “Just checking. Is there a point where someone asks what I’m bringing?”

The room stilled in a way that made her regret speaking.

Maelin turned first. Her eyes dropped, not dramatically — just noticing.

“Oh,” she said.

Ilyra followed her gaze. “Oh.”

Edrin blinked. “You don’t have—”

“No,” Rachel said quickly. “I have… this.” She gestured at herself. “Which I assume is not enough.”

Arathen leaned against the wall, arms crossed. He watched her for a moment longer than the others, then nodded once.

“That’s on us,” he said. No apology. Just fact.

Maelin stood and disappeared into her room, returning with a folded bundle of clothes. She held it out without ceremony.

“These should fit well enough,” she said. “We can adjust later.”

Rachel accepted them automatically, then paused. “You’re sure?”

Maelin smiled, small and warm. “I’m sure.”

Ilyra added, “We’ll pick up more on the way. Towns trade. You don’t need to look like us yet.”

Rachel snorted. “Wasn’t planning to.”

She tucked the clothes beside her, feeling oddly relieved by their weight. Something to carry. Something to misplace.

“What about shoes?” Rachel asked.

Ilyra looked down at her feet. “Those won’t last.”

“Great.”

“We’ll fix that,” Ilyra said. “Sooner rather than later.”

Edrin cleared his throat. “You *are* bringing something,” he said.

Rachel looked at him. “I am?”

“You,” he said, flustered. “Your… perspective.”

Ilyra groaned. “Do not make it weird.”

Rachel laughed, the tension loosening a notch. “Please don’t make me a concept.”

Arathen moved toward the table then, unwrapping the map before anyone could argue about what stayed and what went.

“This comes first,” he said.

Edrin straightened immediately. “That’s a Level Four.”

“I know.”

“You can’t just—”

“I can,” Arathen said mildly. “And we are.”

The map settled slowly, lines surfacing as the light shifted. Rachel leaned in without thinking, then caught herself and hovered instead.

The symbols made sense immediately.

She frowned.

“That road’s gone,” she said.

Edrin blinked. “Which?”

She pointed. “That one. It doesn’t… hold.”

Edrin leaned over, brow furrowing. “It’s marked continuous.”

“It’s not,” Rachel said. “Not anymore.”

Ilyra stepped closer. “That skirts the Near March.”

Rachel glanced up. “You keep saying that like I’m supposed to know what it means.”

Maelin folded her hands. “It’s a place where things don’t quite settle. The land shifts. Routes change.”

“Does it eat people?”

“Not usually,” Ilyra said. “But it does ruin plans.”

Rachel stared at the map again. The Near March pressed against the lines around it, blurring them.

“So we don’t go through it,” Rachel said.

“No,” Arathen agreed. “We go near it.”

Rachel sighed. “Of course we do.”

Edrin hesitated. “The map isn’t that clear.”

Rachel looked at him. “It’s not?”

“No,” he said carefully. “It’s… layered.”

She squinted again. “That feels unnecessary.”

Ilyra snorted.

Arathen watched Rachel instead of the map. “You see it plainly.”

“I guess,” she said, unsettled. “I don’t know why.”

“I know,” he said.

That didn’t help.

They went back to packing after that, quieter but more focused. Books were weighed and rejected. Straps were tightened and loosened. Someone found an extra blanket and argued about whether it was worth the space.

Rachel folded Maelin’s clothes carefully and added them to a borrowed pack.

It wasn’t hers.

But it would do.

By the time the sun shifted low enough to notice, they still weren’t ready.

But the piles had meaning now.

And for the first time, Rachel could see the shape of what she was carrying — and what she wasn’t.
