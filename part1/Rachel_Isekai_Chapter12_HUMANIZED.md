## Chapter Twelve

Packing was not a simple matter.

Rachel had expected efficiency—decisions made quickly, belongings sorted into clear categories of necessary and dispensable. Instead, the morning unfolded in careful negotiations and silent reconsiderations, each person moving through their own internal calculus of what could be carried and what had to be left behind.

Edrin had taken over the table immediately. Books spread before him in stacks that grew and shrank as he reconsidered their necessity. His hands moved between volumes with a kind of restless precision, fingers tracing spines as if touch could determine essential from merely useful.

"You can't carry all of those," Ilyra said. Her tone stayed level, factual.

Edrin's jaw tightened. "These are reference texts."

"Choose three," she said.

"That's not sufficient—"

"Then choose five," Ilyra said. "But you're carrying them yourself, and we're walking."

Edrin stared at the books as if the weight of the decision matched the weight of the volumes. Finally, reluctantly, he moved one thick tome from the keep pile to the discard pile. The motion looked like it cost him something.

Rachel watched from the floor near the far wall, legs folded beneath her, hands empty. She'd been sitting there long enough that the position had grown uncomfortable, but standing felt like intruding on their preparations.

She had nothing to pack.

The realization had arrived gradually—the others sorting through belongings, making choices, while she sat with nothing to sort, nothing to choose. Everything that had defined her previous existence had vanished with the car. Phone. Wallet. Keys. Photos of Evan. The small, accumulated proof that she'd been someone, somewhere.

She tried to mourn those things. Tried to feel the loss as heavy as it should have been.

Instead, what she felt was something closer to relief.

No phone meant no carefully curated social media presence. No photos of brunch she hadn't enjoyed. No text threads where she'd performed enthusiasm for plans she'd dreaded. No calendar notifications for obligations she'd accepted because refusing felt harder than attending.

The life she'd lost had been so small. So carefully controlled. So exhaustingly maintained.

And she hadn't even realized it until now, when all those carefully maintained pieces were gone and she could finally breathe.

She looked down at her borrowed clothes. Even these weren't hers, and somehow that mattered less than it should have.

"We're terrible hosts," Maelin said suddenly, and Rachel looked up to find her approaching with a bundle of fabric. "You've been here days and we never thought—" She shook her head. "These should fit. They're practical for travel, and they're yours to keep."

The emphasis on that last word made Rachel's throat tight.

"Thank you," she managed.

Maelin knelt down beside her rather than handing the clothes from standing. "I wish we had more to offer. Some of your own things."

"It's not your fault I don't have anything," Rachel said.

"It's our fault you're here at all," Maelin replied gently.

Ilyra appeared with a worn pack and set it beside Rachel. "This was mine when I first started traveling. It's good. Sturdy. It'll carry what you need."

Rachel stared at it. "You're giving me your pack?"

"I have another," Ilyra said. "Better one, actually. This one deserves someone who'll appreciate it."

The casual generosity undid something in Rachel's chest. "I don't know what to say."

"You don't have to say anything," Ilyra replied.

Ilyra appeared with a worn pack and set it beside Rachel without comment. "You'll need this."

Rachel stared at it for a moment before tucking the clothes inside. The simple act of having something to put away, somewhere to put it, steadied her more than she'd expected. She folded each piece with more care than necessary, attention fixed on the ordinary task.

"Shoes," Ilyra said, looking at Rachel's feet. "Those won't last a day on the road."

Rachel looked down at her work flats, still somehow intact despite everything that had happened. They belonged to a different life. A different person. "I know."

"We'll find something in the first town," Ilyra said. "It can't wait longer than that."

Rachel nodded.

Arathen moved to the table and began unwrapping something from protective cloth. The fabric fell away to reveal a map—not paper, but something that looked aged and preserved, surface marked with lines that seemed to shift as the light changed angle.

"This guides us," he said.

Edrin straightened, attention immediately focused. "You're bringing that."

"Yes."

"That's—" He stopped himself, then continued more carefully. "That's not commonly traveled with."

"No," Arathen agreed. "It isn't."

The map spread across the table as Arathen weighted the corners. Lines emerged slowly, as if the surface needed time to remember what it was meant to show. Rachel found herself drawn closer, pulled by something she couldn't name.

The symbols resolved into clarity as she looked at them—not gradually, but all at once, as if they'd been waiting for her attention specifically.

She frowned, leaning closer.

"That route is broken," she said, pointing to a line that curved through the eastern section. "You'll want to avoid it."

Edrin moved beside her immediately, following her gesture. "It's marked as continuous on the map."

"I know what it shows," Rachel said. "But it's wrong. The route is interrupted. Like something pulled it apart or—" She tilted her head, trying to understand what she was seeing. "Like it's trying to exist in two places at once and failing at both."

Ilyra leaned in to look where Rachel pointed. "That passes near the Near March. If it's destabilizing..." She trailed off, concern evident.

Rachel glanced up at her. "I keep hearing about this March. What is it?"

Maelin's hands folded together at her waist. "It's a place where the boundaries between worlds grow thin. Things don't settle properly there. Land shifts. Roads appear one day and vanish the next."

"So, actively dangerous," Rachel said.

"Unpredictable," Maelin said. "Which can be worse."

Rachel looked back at the map, finding other routes, tracing them with her finger. "This way looks more stable. Longer, but solid."

Edrin had been studying both the map and Rachel's face. "You're reading the conditional layers," he said, wonder creeping into his voice. "Routes that exist only sometimes, depending on factors most people can't even see."

Rachel looked at him. "There are layers?"

"The map shows multiple routes that overlap and change based on conditions," he explained. "Current weather, magical density, time of day, proximity to boundaries. It usually takes trained cartographers hours to parse them all out."

She looked back at the map. "They just look... different to me. Like different colors, almost, though that's not quite right."

Arathen was smiling slightly. "That's a remarkable gift."

"It's useful," Ilyra agreed, sounding impressed. "Might keep us alive."

Rachel felt her face warm at the praise. "I'm just reading what's there."

"No," Edrin said earnestly. "You're reading what's there in a way most people can't. That's valuable, Rachel. Really valuable."

The acknowledgment settled strange but not unwelcome in her chest.

They returned to their preparations after that—quieter, more deliberate. Edrin made his final selections, each book placed in his pack with visible reluctance for those left behind. Ilyra checked straps and weight distribution with practiced efficiency. Maelin wrapped something in cloth and tucked it carefully into the bottom of her pack where it wouldn't shift.

Rachel watched them work, then looked down at her own pack. One borrowed set of clothes. No personal objects. No accumulated history. Everything that had marked her as herself—photos, documents, small objects carried more for sentiment than function—all of it gone.

She should have felt lighter.

Instead, the absence weighed more than possessions ever had.

The afternoon sun angled lower through the windows, casting long shadows across the floor. They weren't ready yet—wouldn't be ready for hours still—but the shape of departure had formed. The building seemed to sense it too. Its hum had changed subtly, shifted to something that felt less like observation and more like anticipation.

Rachel closed her pack and set it beside the others.

Not hers. But hers to carry.

For the first time since arriving, she could see the outline of what came next—not clearly, not completely, but enough to know they were moving toward it whether she felt prepared or not.
