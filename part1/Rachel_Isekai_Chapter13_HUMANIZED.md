## Chapter Thirteen

They left later than planned.

Rachel noticed because she’d been braced for the moment — the door closing, the sense of crossing a line — and instead it happened sideways, in pieces. Someone went back for a strap they’d forgotten. Someone else argued briefly about which way the sun was moving. By the time they actually stepped onto the road, it felt less like departure and more like drift.

The road itself was narrower than Rachel expected. Packed earth, not stone, worn into a shallow channel by feet and wheels that had learned where to go and kept doing it. Grass pressed in from both sides, stubborn and uneven, like it didn’t believe in the road’s authority.

Rachel adjusted the borrowed pack for the third time in as many minutes.

“Stop fighting it,” Ilyra said without turning around.

“I’m not,” Rachel said.

“You are.”

Rachel let the straps sit where they were. The weight settled in a way that made her shoulders ache immediately. She grimaced.

Maelin slowed until she was walking beside her. “It’ll feel worse before it feels better,” she said. “Then worse again.”

“That’s encouraging.”

Maelin smiled. “It’s honest.”

They walked in loose formation. Ilyra ahead, scanning the road with the casual attention of someone who’d learned which details mattered. Edrin just behind her, glancing down at the map every few minutes and then looking up like he was double-checking reality. Arathen drifted, sometimes beside Rachel, sometimes a few steps behind, never quite in the same place twice.

The Near March didn’t announce itself.

Rachel had expected something obvious — a sign, a change in color, the land doing something dramatic — but instead it crept in quietly. The air felt heavier, not unpleasant, just reluctant. Sounds didn’t carry the way she expected. A birdcall faded too quickly. Footsteps felt swallowed.

She frowned. “Is it supposed to feel like this?”

Ilyra glanced back. “Like what?”

“Like the world’s holding its breath.”

Edrin looked up sharply. “You feel that?”

Rachel hesitated. “I think so.”

Arathen slowed until he was walking between them. “That’s the edge,” he said. “You’re noticing it sooner than most.”

“That’s not comforting,” Rachel said.

“No,” he agreed. “But it’s useful.”

They didn’t go any closer. The map didn’t want them to. Edrin muttered about gradients and probability curves, then stopped when Rachel pointed slightly left.

“That way’s better,” she said.

Edrin frowned. “The road bends right.”

“It does,” Rachel said. “But it doesn’t like it.”

Ilyra snorted. “Great. Even the road has opinions.”

They took the left bend. The pressure eased almost immediately.

Edrin stared at the map. “It just updated.”

Rachel didn’t look at it. She focused on the rhythm of walking instead. Step. Weight. Shift. The road felt… responsive. Not alive. Just aware, like a surface that remembered being used.

After an hour, her legs burned.

After two, her shoulders ached.

She didn’t complain. Mostly because everyone else looked like this was normal.

They stopped when Maelin said they should, not because anyone argued. Packs came off. Water was shared. Rachel drank more than she meant to and immediately regretted it.

“So,” she said, wiping her mouth. “How far did we go?”

Edrin checked the map. “Less than we planned.”

“Of course.”

“But farther than we would have if we’d taken the other bend,” he added.

Rachel nodded, strangely pleased.

They ate something small and unremarkable. Rachel couldn’t tell if it was meant to taste that bland or if her mouth was just tired.

As they walked again, the world opened up in small ways. A farmhouse set back from the road. A pair of travelers heading the opposite direction who nodded without stopping. Someone’s laughter drifting from somewhere Rachel couldn’t see.

This wasn’t wilderness.

That unsettled her more than she expected.

By late afternoon, her pack felt like it had doubled in weight. She was just deciding whether she could ask for a break without sounding weak when Ilyra slowed.

“That’s far enough,” she said.

Rachel almost sagged with relief.

They stepped off the road into a shallow stand of trees. Nothing dramatic. Just enough cover to feel private.

Maelin knelt, checking the ground. “Here’s fine.”

Edrin started unstrapping his pack. “We can make camp before the light—”

“I know,” Ilyra said. “I’m not new.”

Rachel dropped her pack and stretched, wincing as her back protested. “So this is… camping.”

“For now,” Arathen said.

Rachel eyed the trees. “I don’t see—”

“Wait,” Ilyra said, grinning faintly.

Rachel crossed her arms, skeptical.

“Okay,” she said. “I’m waiting.”

Ilyra set her pack down and unrolled something that looked, at first glance, deeply disappointing.

Rachel stared. “That’s it?”

“It’s a tent,” Ilyra said.

“That’s not a tent,” Rachel said. “That’s a suggestion.”

Maelin hid a smile as she knelt to help. “It doesn’t look like much.”

Edrin winced. “It never does.”

They moved with practiced familiarity, poles clicking into place in an order Rachel couldn’t follow. The fabric went up faster than she expected, the shape resolving into something small and stubborn-looking, like it would rather be anywhere else.

Rachel circled it once. “We all fit in there.”

“Yes,” Ilyra said.

“No, I mean,” Rachel gestured, “we fit in there.”

Arathen watched her with mild interest. “You’re assuming the inside matches the outside.”

Rachel stopped. “It doesn’t.”

“No.”

“That feels like cheating.”

“Magic,” Ilyra said cheerfully, driving a stake into the ground.

When Maelin lifted the flap and stepped inside, Rachel leaned forward automatically, peering past her shoulder.

She froze.

The interior opened out instead of back. Space unfolded where it shouldn’t have been, clean lines resolving into rooms that felt solid in a way canvas had no right to. A central space with a low table and shelves already set into the walls. Light, soft and even, coming from nowhere Rachel could see.

Maelin turned back toward her. “You can come in.”

Rachel didn’t move.

Edrin brushed past her, already halfway inside. “Mind the threshold. It sometimes—” He paused, looking around. “—adjusts.”

Rachel swallowed. “That’s illegal.”

Ilyra laughed. “Wait until you see the kitchen.”

“There’s a kitchen,” Rachel said faintly.

“Yes,” Maelin said. “But no food.”

Rachel stepped in slowly, half-expecting the space to snap shut or correct itself. It didn’t. The floor was steady under her boots. The air smelled faintly of woodsmoke and something herbal she couldn’t place.

There were doors. Actual doors.

“How many people does this sleep?” she asked.

“Five,” Ilyra said. “Comfortably.”

Rachel stared at her. “You carry this.”

“Yes.”

“And we still have to hunt.”

“Yes.”

“That’s cruel.”

“Extremely,” Ilyra agreed.

Rachel laughed, a short, incredulous sound that surprised her. She dropped her pack just inside the entrance and let herself lean against the wall, feeling the solid press of it against her back.

Her feet hurt. Her shoulders ached. Her head was buzzing with roads and pressure and the Near March breathing somewhere just out of sight.

But for the first time all day, the world wasn’t asking anything from her.

Maelin touched her arm lightly. “You did well today.”

Rachel huffed. “I walked.”

“You kept going,” Maelin said.

Rachel closed her eyes for a moment, then nodded. “Yeah,” she said. “I guess I did.”

Outside, the light faded between the trees. Inside, the tent held steady, indifferent to dusk.

Rachel opened her eyes and looked around again, at the borrowed space and the people who’d brought her this far.

“Okay,” she said. “I officially don’t know what’s normal anymore.”

Arathen smiled faintly. “That feeling will pass.”

She glanced at him. “I don’t believe you.”

“Good,” he said. “Then you’re paying attention.”

Rachel sank down onto one of the benches, the exhaustion finally catching up to her.

Outside, the road went on without them.

For now, that was fine.
