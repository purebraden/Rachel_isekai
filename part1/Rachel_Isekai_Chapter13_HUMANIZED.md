## Chapter Thirteen

They left later than planned.

Rachel had anticipated a clean departure—a moment when they'd close the door behind them and step deliberately onto the road. Instead, it happened gradually, in fragments. Someone returned for forgotten supplies. Someone else debated the sun's position and what that meant for their timing. By the time they actually left, the departure felt less like a decision and more like an inevitable drift.

The road stretched narrow before them—packed earth worn smooth by years of passage, edges blurred where grass encroached. It looked more like a suggestion than a definitive path, as if the land hadn't fully committed to the idea of roads.

Rachel adjusted her pack for the third time in as many minutes. The straps sat wrong no matter how she positioned them, weight pulling at her shoulders in ways her body didn't know how to accommodate.

"Stop adjusting," Ilyra said without looking back.

Rachel's hands stilled. "It doesn't fit right."

"It won't," Ilyra said. "Not for days."

Rachel left the straps alone. The weight settled into an ache that started immediate and promised to grow worse. She focused on the road ahead instead of the discomfort spreading across her shoulders.

Maelin fell back until she walked beside Rachel. "The first day is the hardest," she said. "Your body doesn't know what you're asking it to do yet."

"When does it get easier?" Rachel asked.

"It doesn't," Maelin said. "You just get stronger."

Rachel didn't find that particularly comforting.

They walked in loose formation, each person settling into a natural position. Ilyra moved ahead, attention scanning the road with the learned focus of someone who knew which details mattered and which could be ignored. Edrin followed several paces back, consulting the map periodically before looking up to confirm what he'd read against what he saw. Arathen drifted—sometimes beside Rachel, sometimes behind, his position shifting without apparent pattern.

The Near March didn't announce its proximity.

Rachel had expected something visible—a boundary marker, a shift in vegetation, some clear indication that they'd entered a different region. Instead, awareness crept in gradually. The air grew denser, not oppressive but present in a way it hadn't been before. Sound behaved differently here. A birdcall began and faded too quickly, cut short as if the air itself had absorbed it. Their footsteps seemed to vanish before the sound could travel.

Rachel's frown deepened. "Something's different."

Ilyra glanced back over her shoulder. "Different how?"

"The air," Rachel said. "It's—" She searched for the word. "Waiting."

Edrin's attention snapped to her immediately. "You're sensing the boundary?"

"I think so," Rachel said.

Arathen adjusted his pace until he walked between them. "That's the March's edge. Most people don't notice it until they're much closer."

Rachel's unease deepened. "Is that bad?"

"It's informative," Arathen said. "And yes, somewhat concerning."

They didn't move any nearer to it. Edrin consulted the map more frequently, muttering about boundary shifts and stability gradients. Then Rachel stopped and pointed to their left.

"That direction," she said. "The pressure is lower there."

Edrin looked up from the map. "The marked route continues right."

"I know," Rachel said. "But left is better."

"Better how?" he asked.

Rachel struggled to articulate what she sensed. "The road to the right—it's compromised. Not broken, but weak. Like walking on ice that's starting to thin."

Ilyra studied the terrain in both directions. "The left looks rougher."

"It is," Rachel said. "But it's stable."

They took the left path.

The pressure eased almost immediately, like stepping out of a room where the air had grown too close.

Edrin stared at the map, then looked up, then back down. "It changed," he said quietly. "The route just updated."

Rachel focused on walking—the rhythm of it, the repetition of step and weight and shift. The road felt aware somehow, not sentient but responsive, like a surface that remembered the passage of feet and adjusted itself accordingly.

After an hour, her legs burned.

After two, her shoulders ached.

She didn’t complain. Mostly because everyone else looked like this was normal.

They stopped when Maelin said they should, not because anyone argued. Packs came off. Water was shared. Rachel drank more than she meant to and immediately regretted it.

“So,” she said, wiping her mouth. “How far did we go?”

Edrin checked the map. “Less than we planned.”

“Of course.”

“But farther than we would have if we’d taken the other bend,” he added.

Rachel nodded, strangely pleased.

They ate something small and unremarkable. Rachel couldn’t tell if it was meant to taste that bland or if her mouth was just tired.

As they walked again, the world opened up in small ways. A farmhouse set back from the road. A pair of travelers heading the opposite direction who nodded without stopping. Someone’s laughter drifting from somewhere Rachel couldn’t see.

This wasn’t wilderness.

That unsettled her more than she expected.

By late afternoon, the pack's weight had become nearly unbearable. Rachel's shoulders burned with each step, the straps cutting into muscle that hadn't known this kind of sustained strain existed. She was calculating how to ask for a rest without revealing how badly she needed one when Ilyra slowed.

"We stop here," she said.

Relief flooded through Rachel so intensely it felt almost like pain.

They left the road, moving into a shallow grove of trees that offered cover without feeling enclosed. The ground looked level enough, clear enough.

Maelin crouched to examine the earth, pressing her palm flat against it. "This will do."

Edrin began unstrapping his pack, movements economical despite his obvious fatigue.

Rachel let her pack slide from her shoulders. The sudden absence of weight made her feel unbalanced, as if she might float away without it anchoring her. She stretched carefully, feeling her spine protest the motion.

"I don't see anywhere to shelter," she said, looking around the grove.

Ilyra was already unpacking. "Give it a moment."

She pulled out what looked like canvas—aged and folded small, unremarkable in every visible way. Rachel watched as Ilyra and Maelin began setting it up with practiced efficiency, poles appearing and clicking into place with motions too quick to follow. The structure that emerged looked small, barely large enough for one person, much less five.

Rachel stared at it. "That's where we're sleeping?"

"Yes," Ilyra said.

Rachel circled it once, trying to make the dimensions work in her mind. They didn't. "I don't understand how we fit."

Arathen watched her process this. "You're assuming the interior space corresponds to the exterior."

Rachel looked at him. Looked back at the tent. "It doesn't?"

"No."

The impossibility of that settled cold in her chest. Magic was one thing when it involved stopping beads or reading impossible maps. This felt different—a violation of something more fundamental.

Maelin lifted the entrance flap and stepped through without ceremony.

Rachel moved closer, then hesitated at the threshold. She could see past the opening now—see that the space inside didn't match what the outside promised. Walls extended farther than they should. Light came from no visible source. The floor looked solid in a way canvas shouldn't allow.

"It's safe," Maelin said from inside. "I promise."

Rachel took a breath and stepped through.

The interior unfolded around her—not gradually, but all at once, as if space itself had been folded and was now remembering its true dimensions. A central room opened before her, walls hung with fabric that somehow felt permanent. A low table occupied the center. Shelves lined one wall, already stocked with supplies. Doorways led to other rooms, suggesting privacy and separation that the exterior couldn't possibly contain.

The floor held steady beneath her feet. The air smelled of woodsmoke and herbs, faint but present.

Rachel stood very still, trying to process what her eyes told her against what her understanding of space insisted should be true.

"Five people sleep here?" she asked quietly.

"Comfortably," Ilyra said, stepping in behind her.

Rachel's hands curled at her sides. She wanted to laugh but couldn't quite manage it. Wanted to protest but didn't have words for what felt wrong about this.

She dropped her pack near the entrance and let herself lean against the wall, needing the solid press of it to confirm that at least this part was real.

Her feet ached. Her shoulders throbbed. The Near March's pressure still lingered at the edges of her awareness, patient and watchful.

But here, inside this impossible space, nothing demanded her attention. Nothing asked for her reaction or her compliance.

Maelin's hand touched her arm briefly. "You made it through the first day."

Rachel opened her eyes. "I walked. That's all."

"You kept walking," Maelin said. "That's not nothing."

Rachel nodded slowly, accepting this if not quite believing it.

Outside, light began to fade between the trees, shadows lengthening across ground they'd covered. Inside, the tent maintained its impossible steady presence, indifferent to the progression of time beyond its walls.

Rachel found a bench and sat, letting the exhaustion finally settle fully into her bones. Her body catalogued the day's damage—blisters forming, muscles strained past familiar limits, a headache building behind her eyes from concentration and sun.

Around her, the others moved through their evening routines with practiced efficiency. Edrin sorted through his pack, checking that nothing had shifted wrong. Ilyra examined her boots for damage. Maelin began unpacking what they'd need for the night.

Normal actions. Ordinary preparations.

Except nothing about this was ordinary.

Rachel looked around the impossible space, at the walls that shouldn't exist, at the people who'd pulled her from one world into another and were now trying to keep her alive in this one.

She didn't know what normal meant anymore. Wasn't sure she'd recognize it if she found it.

Outside, the road continued without them, patient and waiting.

Inside, Rachel sat very still and tried to believe that rest was possible.
