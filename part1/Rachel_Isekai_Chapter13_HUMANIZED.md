## Chapter Thirteen

The tent didn't settle around Rachel the way shelter should.

She'd expected arrival to feel like rest—a moment when her body recognized safety and allowed itself to stop. Instead, the space remained stubbornly temporary in her mind, warm and quiet but refusing to register as destination. Her awareness kept reaching beyond the impossible walls, tracking the road outside, measuring the distance they'd covered against the distance still ahead.

She sat on the edge of her assigned bed, examining one sock with more attention than it warranted. Was it damp? Or had her foot simply changed shape after hours of walking? The mattress adjusted beneath her when she shifted, responding in a way that felt wrong—too attentive, as if the bed itself was watching.

Across the central space, Ilyra worked at a piece of wood with a small knife, the blade moving in short, irregular strokes. No visible goal shaped the carving. The sound repeated with enough irregularity that Rachel noticed its absence as much as its presence.

Maelin stood near the cooking area, holding a jar and reading its label. She read it twice, then set it back without opening it. Her hands moved to another container and repeated the process.

Edrin sat at the low table, book closed in front of him, fingertips resting on the cover as if to prevent it from opening on its own.

Arathen leaned in the doorway, gaze fixed on nothing in particular, attention turned inward or outward—Rachel couldn't tell which.

The silence pressed in from all sides, thick with unspoken thoughts.

Rachel broke it. "The town we're heading toward," Rachel said, breaking the silence. "What should I expect?"

Maelin looked up, setting aside the jar she'd been examining. "Are you worried about it?"

Rachel shrugged, trying for casual and not quite managing it. "I don't know what I'm walking into."

Edrin set his book aside, giving her his full attention. "It's a trading town. Mixed population. People are used to seeing travelers, so you won't stand out too much."

"Will they know what I am?" Rachel asked. "Will they be able to tell?"

"Tell what?" Ilyra asked.

Rachel pulled her knees closer. "That I don't belong. That I'm from somewhere else. That I can do things I shouldn't be able to do." She paused, then added, "Speaking of which—this tent. It's made of magic, right?"

Arathen's attention sharpened slightly. "It is."

"So what happens if I—" Rachel gestured vaguely. "If my powers react to it? If I accidentally try to pause or tilt something that's already folded through impossible space?"

"That's a good question," Arathen admitted. "The tent exists in a stable pocket. It shouldn't interact with your abilities the way normal space does."

"Shouldn't," Rachel repeated.

"We're fairly certain," Edrin added, then caught himself. "Actually, we're mostly certain based on theory, but we've never had someone with your specific abilities sleep in it before."

Rachel's eyebrows rose. "That's not as reassuring as you think it is."

"If something feels wrong, you wake us," Maelin said firmly. "Immediately. Don't try to handle it alone."

Rachel nodded, then pressed her palm flat against the tent's floor. The surface felt solid enough, but there was something underneath—a subtle hum, different from the building's pulse but similar in quality. Like two notes played in harmony instead of unison.

Her fingers spread wider against the fabric. "I can feel it. The magic. It's..." She searched for the word. "Singing. Almost."

Arathen leaned forward with interest, that same intense focus from before. "And does it feel hostile? Unstable?"

Rachel concentrated, letting her awareness extend into that hum the way she'd been practicing with the stones. But this time, something shifted. The magic didn't just respond to her touch—it recognized her. Reached back, almost, like greeting like.

Her breath caught. "No. It feels... settled. Like it's been this way so long it forgot it was supposed to be impossible." She pulled her hand back quickly, unsettled by the sensation. "I think we're okay. But I'll tell you if that changes."

Arathen's eyes hadn't left her face. "You felt something else just then. What was it?"

Rachel hesitated. How did she explain that the magic had felt... familiar? Like meeting a distant relative and recognizing your own eyes in their face?

"Nothing," she said. "Just—it's strange, that's all. Feeling magic like it's alive."

Arathen's expression suggested he didn't entirely believe her, but he let it go. "That's all we ask." Something in his tone made it clear he'd filed the moment away for later consideration.

Maelin moved closer, settling beside Rachel. "You belong wherever you are. You're not less real just because you started somewhere different."

"But I don't know how to be new here," Rachel admitted. "Back home, I was good at blending in. Good at making myself small and useful and easy to ignore. But here, everything I do feels loud."

"Because you're not trying to disappear anymore," Arathen observed gently.

Rachel looked at him, startled by how precisely that landed.

Edrin leaned forward earnestly. "The people in this town—they're not going to judge you. And if anyone gives you trouble, they'll have to go through all of us first."

"We don't let people hurt our friends," Ilyra added, and the simple declaration of friendship made Rachel's eyes sting.

"I just don't want to mess this up," Rachel said. "Don't want to be the reason something goes wrong. I have a talent for that."

Maelin's expression softened with understanding. "Rachel, you've been here less than a week and you've already saved us from taking a compromised route, read a map that most trained scholars can't parse, and handled powers that would send most people into shock. You're not the liability you think you are."

"You really think that?" Rachel asked quietly.

"I know that," Maelin said firmly. "We all do."

The tent held them in comfortable closeness—not quite silent, but filled with the kind of quiet that came from people who'd begun to trust each other. Five people in an impossible space that somehow felt exactly right.

"What actually happens when we reach the town?" Rachel asked. "Best guess?"

"They'll be curious," Arathen said. "Probably cautious. We're asking them to harbor someone who crosses boundaries in unusual ways. That makes people nervous."

"So we're hoping for tolerance," Rachel said.

"We're hoping for understanding," Maelin corrected. "And if we don't get it from the town, we'll go somewhere else. You're not negotiable."

The fierceness in her voice surprised Rachel. "You barely know me."

"We know enough," Edrin said. "You're patient when we fumble explanations. You make breakfast without being asked. You warn us away from danger. Those aren't small things."

"Also you haven't run screaming yet," Ilyra added. "Which shows remarkable judgment."

Rachel huffed out something close to a laugh. "The bar is low, huh?"

"The bar is exactly where it needs to be," Ilyra replied.

Rachel lay back on the bed, staring at where the ceiling met the wall in a seam that curved impossibly. The tent didn't feel temporary anymore. It felt like shelter. Like safety.

"I'm afraid," she admitted quietly. "Of what happens next. Of who I'm becoming." She paused, then forced out the rest. "Of not knowing if I'll ever get home. Of not knowing if I even want to anymore."

The admission hung in the air like a confession.

Maelin's hand found Rachel's shoulder. "That's reasonable. All of that is reasonable."

But it wasn't, was it? What kind of person chose a world of magic and danger and impossible spaces over the safe, known life they'd left behind? What kind of person felt more at home with kidnappers than with a boyfriend who loved them?

The answer settled cold in Rachel's chest: the kind of person who'd been drowning slowly for twenty-six years and had only just learned what air tasted like.

"I should want to go back," Rachel said. "Evan is there. My job. My whole life. I should be fighting every minute to get back to them."

The emotions rose sharp and fast—guilt, grief, confusion—and with them came a familiar warmth spreading through her palm. Rachel's breath caught. The pressure building in her chest, that telltale tightness—

She recognized it now. Caught it before it could pool and trap itself.

Rachel pressed her hand flat against the bed and breathed deliberately. In through her nose. Out through her mouth. Let it flow instead of holding it. The warmth pulsed once, twice, then faded like a candle blown out.

The tent stayed stable around them.

"But you're not," Ilyra said. Not a question. If she'd noticed the brief surge of magic, she didn't mention it.

"No." Rachel's voice barely rose above a whisper, but steadier now. "I'm not. And I don't know what that makes me."

"Human." Arathen's voice was quiet but certain. "It makes you human."

He met her eyes across the dimming space, and Rachel realized he had noticed. Had seen her catch it, control it, let it go. The slight nod he gave her was acknowledgment and approval both.

"We're afraid too," Edrin added. "Of what we've set in motion. Of whether we can help you the way you need. But we're less afraid when we're together."

Arathen's voice carried weight despite its softness. "Found family is like that. You choose each other. And then you keep choosing."

Rachel closed her eyes, letting the words settle. The light began to fade—not abruptly, but gradually, as if the space itself had decided day was finished. Around her, the others prepared for sleep. Small sounds of settling. Fabric shifting. Breath evening out.

"Thank you," Rachel said into the dimming space. "For choosing me."

"Right back at you," Ilyra replied, and something in her voice said she meant it.

Rachel lay there as the others' breathing deepened into sleep. She thought about Evan. Tried to picture his face with the clarity he deserved—the specific way his mouth pulled when he smiled, the gray T-shirt he wore on bad days.

The image came slower than it should have. Blurrier than Maelin's or Edrin's or even Ilyra's.

She'd known them less than a week.

She'd known him two years.

Rachel pressed her palm against her chest, feeling her heartbeat, and tried not to think about what that meant. About what she'd already started choosing without choosing.

About what it said about her that when she pictured home now, she saw folded canvas and impossible space and three people who'd kidnapped her and somehow become the ones she couldn't imagine leaving.

The missing piece she'd felt her entire life—that gap she'd carried through coffee shops and office buildings and dinner with Evan—it wasn't missing anymore. Or maybe it had never been missing at all. Maybe she'd just been in the wrong place for it to exist.

Here, in this impossible tent with these impossible people, she was whole.

And that truth was more terrifying than any magic she'd discovered.

If they found a way to send her back tomorrow, she'd have to decide.

She wasn't ready for that choice. Wasn't sure she'd ever be.

But deep down, underneath the guilt and the fear and the confusion, she already knew what she'd choose. Had been choosing it, without choosing, from the moment she'd stopped the glass from falling.

Rachel closed her eyes and listened to breathing that wasn't hers.

Outside, the road went on without them.
