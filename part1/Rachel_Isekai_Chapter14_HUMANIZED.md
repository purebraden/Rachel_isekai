## Chapter Fourteen

The tent didn’t settle the way Rachel expected it to.

She kept waiting for the sense of arrival — that small internal click that meant this is where we stop — but it never came. The space held steady, warm enough, quiet enough, but her body didn’t seem convinced.

She sat on the edge of her bed, turning one sock inside out and then back again, trying to decide whether it was damp or if her foot just felt wrong. The mattress dipped when she shifted, adjusting in a way that felt more responsive than comfortable.

Across the central space, Ilyra carved at a piece of wood with a small knife, stopping and starting without any clear goal. The sound wasn’t loud, but it repeated often enough that Rachel noticed when it stopped.

Maelin stood near the cooking space, reading a label twice before setting the jar back down unopened. Edrin sat at the table with his book closed this time, fingertips resting on the cover like he was keeping it from wandering off.

Arathen leaned against the doorframe, watching nothing in particular.

No one spoke.

Rachel cleared her throat. “So when we get there.”

Maelin looked up. “Where?”

“The town,” Rachel said. “The… not-remarkable one.”

Edrin exhaled through his nose. “It’s remarkable if you know what to look for.”

“That’s not helpful,” Rachel said.

“No,” he agreed. “Sorry.”

Ilyra set the knife down. “People will notice you,” she said. “Not because you’re strange. Just because you’re new.”

Rachel nodded. “I’m good at new.”

Ilyra raised an eyebrow. “Are you?”

Rachel opened her mouth, then paused. “I mean. I thought I was.”

That earned her a look from Maelin — not concern, exactly, but attention.

“You don’t have to prove anything,” Maelin said.

“I wasn’t planning to,” Rachel said quickly. “I just—” She stopped. Tried again. “I don’t want to mess this up.”

Edrin frowned. “This isn’t something you can mess up.”

“That’s not true,” Rachel said. The words came out sharper than she meant. “People mess things up all the time just by showing up.”

The air shifted. Not dramatically. Just enough.

Maelin didn’t answer right away. Ilyra looked down at her hands. Arathen tilted his head slightly, studying Rachel with a new focus.

“You’re not wrong,” Arathen said eventually. “But this isn’t all on you.”

Rachel laughed once, short. “It kind of is.”

“No,” he said. “It kind of isn’t.”

They sat with that, the disagreement unresolved.

The tent hummed softly — not a sound so much as a pressure, like enclosed air responding to breath and movement. Rachel became acutely aware of how close everyone was. Five people. One space. Too many small noises.

She shifted again, then stopped moving altogether.

“What are we actually expecting when we get there?” she asked. “Not the plan. The… vibe.”

Ilyra snorted. “You’re not going to like it.”

Rachel winced. “That’s encouraging.”

“Honest,” Ilyra corrected.

Edrin spoke without looking up. “We’re hoping for neutrality.”

“That’s the goal?” Rachel said. “Neutral?”

Maelin nodded. “Neutral means time.”

Rachel lay back, staring at the ceiling seam that curved where it shouldn’t. The tent didn’t feel unsafe. But it didn’t feel like a reward either. It felt like a pause button that might stop working if pressed too long.

“Do you think they’ll recognize me?” she asked.

No one answered immediately.

“Recognize how?” Maelin asked gently.

Rachel swallowed. “As something they already understand.”

Arathen straightened slightly. “I don’t think anyone understands you yet.”

That wasn’t comforting.

Rachel closed her eyes, listening to the small sounds — fabric shifting, a breath held too long, the faint creak of the tent responding to weight.

“Okay,” she said quietly. “Then I guess that’s fine.”

No one corrected her.

The light dimmed gradually, not like a lamp going out, but like the space deciding it was done paying attention. Someone lay down. Someone else turned their back. The knife stayed where it was.

Rachel stayed awake longer than she meant to, aware of the road waiting outside, the map folded but not quiet, the Near March breathing somewhere beyond the trees.

Inside the tent, nothing asked anything of her.

That didn’t mean she felt ready.

Only that she’d stopped moving.
