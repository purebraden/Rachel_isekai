## Chapter Fourteen

The tent came down easier than it had gone up.

Rachel watched Arathen work, hands moving through a sequence that looked like folding laundry but felt like dismantling architecture. The impossible space collapsed into itself—not violently, just deliberately—until what remained was a square of canvas no larger than a dinner napkin.

"That shouldn't be possible," Rachel said.

"No," Arathen agreed, tucking the folded tent into his pack. "It shouldn't."

Around them, the others moved through their own morning routines with practiced efficiency. Edrin rolled his bedding tight and secured it with leather straps. Maelin checked their water supply, redistributing weight between packs. Ilyra knelt by the dead fire, burying the ashes and scattering leaves over the disturbed earth until no trace of their camp remained.

Rachel stood uselessly in the middle of it all, holding her borrowed pack and feeling like an imposter playing at adventure.

"You're doing it again," Ilyra said without looking up.

"Doing what?"

"Standing like you're waiting for permission to exist." Ilyra rose, dusting her hands. "You're part of this. Act like it."

Rachel's face warmed. "I don't know what to do."

"Then ask," Maelin said, not unkindly. "Or watch and learn. But don't hover like you're apologizing for taking up space."

The words should have stung. Instead, they settled like an invitation.

Rachel looked around, assessing. The packs were almost ready. The camp was nearly erased. What was left?

"Food," she said. "We need to eat."

"Smart," Edrin said, pausing his packing to glance at her. "We have trail rations, but they're meant to supplement, not sustain. We'll need to hunt or forage today."

"I can help with that," Rachel said, then immediately second-guessed herself. Could she? She'd never hunted in her life. Never even been camping, really, unless you counted the one corporate retreat where they'd stayed in cabins with Wi-Fi.

Arathen's eyes found hers across the clearing. "You might be more help than you think."

Something in his tone made her pulse quicken. He knew. Of course he knew. He'd been planning this.

Twenty minutes later, they broke camp as the light shifted from green-gray to something almost golden. The forest around them felt alive in a way that woods back home never had—not threatening exactly, but aware. Watching.

Rachel walked between Maelin and Edrin, her pack settling into a rhythm against her shoulders. The borrowed boots Ilyra had found in the last town were stiff but functional, and after an hour of walking, her feet had started to remember how to move over uneven ground.

"There," Ilyra said quietly, stopping so suddenly that Rachel nearly walked into her.

Everyone froze.

Ilyra pointed ahead and to the left, where the undergrowth thinned near a stand of silver-barked trees. At first, Rachel saw nothing. Then movement—a flicker of brown, low to the ground.

A rabbit. Larger than the ones back home, with ears that swiveled independently and fur that seemed to shift color depending on the angle of light. It was nibbling at something green, nose twitching.

Edrin's hand moved slowly toward the bow strapped across his back.

The rabbit's head snapped up.

"Wait," Arathen said softly. He was looking at Rachel. "Let her try."

Rachel's stomach dropped. "I've never—"

"You don't need to kill it," he said. "Just stop it. Give Edrin time to aim."

The rabbit was already moving, haunches tensing to bolt.

Rachel's hands went cold. "I don't know if I can—"

"You can," Arathen said. Not a question. A statement.

The rabbit leaped.

Rachel's hand shot out—pure instinct, no thought—and the world caught.

Not completely. Not like the cup, where everything had frozen solid. This was different. Gentler. The rabbit hung mid-leap, legs extended, but it was still moving—just impossibly slowly, like it was pushing through water instead of air.

Rachel's breath came short and fast. The warmth was there in her palm, familiar now, but controlled. Flowing instead of pooling. She could feel the boundaries of what she was doing—not stopping time, but bending it, stretching the moment until it lasted longer than physics allowed.

Edrin moved. Smooth. Practiced. Drew the bow. Aimed.

Released.

The arrow flew true.

Rachel let go.

The world resumed. The rabbit dropped, already dead before it hit the ground. Quick. Clean.

Rachel stood there, hand still outstretched, heart hammering.

"Good," Ilyra said. Just that. But she sounded impressed.

Maelin squeezed Rachel's shoulder as she passed, moving to help Edrin retrieve the kill.

Arathen hadn't moved. He was watching Rachel with that same intensity from before—measuring, cataloging. But beneath the observation was something else. Satisfaction, maybe. Or confirmation.

"How did that feel?" he asked.

Rachel looked down at her hand. The warmth was already fading, leaving only a pleasant tingle. "Different from before. Not as... heavy."

"Because you're learning control," Arathen said. "Learning to modulate. That's remarkable progress for someone who discovered their abilities less than two weeks ago."

There it was again. That emphasis. That careful choice of words that suggested he was thinking something he wasn't saying.

"It felt easy," Rachel admitted quietly. "Is that bad?"

Arathen's mouth pulled into something that wasn't quite a smile. "That depends on your perspective."

Before Rachel could ask what that meant, Maelin called out, "Two more ahead. Small clearing, thirty paces north."

They moved as a unit now, quieter, purpose focused. Rachel found herself falling into the rhythm without thinking—watching where she stepped, breathing shallow, moving when they moved and stopping when they stopped.

The clearing opened up ahead. Two more rabbits, these larger, grazing near a fallen log.

This time, no one had to tell her what to do.

Rachel reached out—not with her hand, but with that sense she was starting to recognize. The one that felt like touching something intangible, like running her fingers through water that shouldn't exist.

The rabbits slowed.

Not frozen. Not even obviously stopped. Just... delayed. Moving at half-speed, then quarter-speed, their awareness of danger arriving too late to matter.

Edrin took one. Ilyra, bow suddenly in hand, took the other.

The world snapped back.

Rachel swayed, exhaustion pulling at her knees, but Maelin was already there, steadying her.

"I'm okay," Rachel said.

"I know," Maelin replied. "But you're allowed to not be."

They field-dressed the kills with an efficiency that spoke of long practice. Rachel watched, queasy at first, then increasingly fascinated. There was no waste. No cruelty. Just necessity transformed into sustenance with respect and skill.

"You're not squeamish," Edrin observed, glancing up from his work.

"I thought I would be," Rachel admitted. "But it feels... I don't know. Honest?"

"It is," Maelin said. "More honest than buying pre-packaged meat and pretending it appeared by magic."

Rachel almost laughed at that. Here, the magic was real. The meat was earned.

By the time they found a suitable campsite—a clearing near a narrow stream where the water ran clear and cold—the wrapped meat had settled into a comfortable weight in Ilyra's pack. The rabbits roasted over a fire that Ilyra coaxed from damp wood with impressive patience. The smell made Rachel's stomach clench with hunger so sharp it almost hurt.

When had she last been truly hungry? Not snack-hungry or skipping-lunch-because-of-meetings hungry. Actually hungry, where food became something necessary instead of something scheduled.

Edrin portioned the meat carefully, making sure everyone got equal shares. Rachel accepted hers and bit in without waiting for it to cool. The heat stung her tongue, but the flavor—smoky and rich and real—made her not care.

"Slow down," Ilyra said, amused. "It's not going anywhere."

"Sorry," Rachel mumbled around a mouthful.

"Don't be sorry," Maelin said. "Be hungry. You earned it."

That stopped Rachel mid-chew. Earned it. Because she'd helped. Because her powers had been useful instead of terrifying.

She looked across the fire and found Arathen watching her again, expression unreadable in the flickering light.

"What?" Rachel asked.

"You're smiling," he said.

Rachel touched her face. She was. "Is that bad?"

"No," Arathen said quietly. "It's good. You should smile more."

Something in his tone made her chest tighten—not painfully, just aware. She looked away, back to her food, and tried to ignore the warmth that had nothing to do with the fire.

Later, after the meal was finished and the bones were buried and the fire had burned down to coals, Rachel sat with her back against a tree and watched the sky darken through unfamiliar constellations.

The satisfaction from the hunt lingered—not just the success, but the ease of it. The way her power had responded without hesitation, without fear. She'd helped. Actually helped. Made a real difference instead of just taking up space.

"You're thinking too loud," Ilyra said from somewhere to her left.

Rachel huffed. "Is that possible?"

"With you, apparently."

Rachel let the silence settle before speaking again. "I used to have panic attacks about being useless. About not contributing enough at work, at home, in my relationship. Like I was always one mistake away from people realizing I didn't actually belong anywhere."

"And now?" Maelin asked gently.

Rachel looked at her hands—the same hands that had stopped time, that had made the hunt possible, that had helped feed the people around her. "Now I stopped two rabbits mid-leap so we could eat dinner. And it felt like the most natural thing in the world."

"Because it was," Arathen said. He'd been so quiet she'd almost forgotten he was there. "Natural for you, at least."

There it was again. That implication.

Rachel turned to look at him. "What aren't you telling me?"

Arathen met her gaze steadily. "A lot of things. But most of them are just theories until we reach Sivara. She'll have better answers than I can give you."

"But you have suspicions," Rachel pressed.

"Yes."

"Are they bad?"

Arathen considered that. "They're complicated. And potentially difficult to accept. But bad?" He shook his head slowly. "I don't think so. Different, certainly. But not bad."

Rachel wanted to push, to demand he tell her everything he suspected. But exhaustion was pulling at her now—the good kind, earned through movement and magic and purpose.

"Tomorrow," she said.

"Tomorrow," Arathen agreed.

Rachel pulled her borrowed blanket tighter and let her eyes close. Around her, the others settled into their own sleep. The forest breathed. The stream whispered. The stars wheeled overhead in patterns that had never mapped her home.

And for the first time since the summoning, Rachel fell asleep without dreaming of the life she'd left behind.
