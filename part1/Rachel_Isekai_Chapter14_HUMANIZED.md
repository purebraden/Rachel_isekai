## Chapter Fourteen

The tent didn't settle around Rachel the way shelter should.

She'd expected arrival to feel like rest—a moment when her body recognized safety and allowed itself to stop. Instead, the space remained stubbornly temporary in her mind, warm and quiet but refusing to register as destination. Her awareness kept reaching beyond the impossible walls, tracking the road outside, measuring the distance they'd covered against the distance still ahead.

She sat on the edge of her assigned bed, examining one sock with more attention than it warranted. Was it damp? Or had her foot simply changed shape after hours of walking? The mattress adjusted beneath her when she shifted, responding in a way that felt wrong—too attentive, as if the bed itself was watching.

Across the central space, Ilyra worked at a piece of wood with a small knife, the blade moving in short, irregular strokes. No visible goal shaped the carving. The sound repeated with enough irregularity that Rachel noticed its absence as much as its presence.

Maelin stood near the cooking area, holding a jar and reading its label. She read it twice, then set it back without opening it. Her hands moved to another container and repeated the process.

Edrin sat at the low table, book closed in front of him, fingertips resting on the cover as if to prevent it from opening on its own.

Arathen leaned in the doorway, gaze fixed on nothing in particular, attention turned inward or outward—Rachel couldn't tell which.

The silence pressed in from all sides, thick with unspoken thoughts.

Rachel broke it. "The town we're heading toward."

Maelin looked up. "What about it?"

"What should I expect?" Rachel asked.

Edrin's breath came out slow and measured. "That depends on what you notice."

"That's not an answer," Rachel said.

"No," he agreed. "I'm sorry. It's hard to describe."

Ilyra set her knife aside. "People will notice you. Not because you're obviously foreign. Just because you're new."

Rachel nodded slowly. "I can handle being new."

Ilyra's eyebrow lifted slightly. "Can you?"

Rachel started to respond, then stopped. "I thought I could," she said finally.

Maelin's attention sharpened—not concern, exactly, but increased focus.

"You don't need to be anything in particular," Maelin said carefully.

"I know," Rachel said. The words came too quickly. "I just—" She stopped herself, searching for what she actually meant. "I don't want to be the reason something goes wrong."

Edrin frowned. "How would you be?"

"People ruin things just by being in them," Rachel said. The words emerged harder than she'd intended, carrying edges she hadn't known were there.

The air shifted subtly, responding to words that had exposed more than intended.

Maelin didn't rush to respond. Ilyra's attention dropped to her hands. Arathen's gaze settled on Rachel with increased focus, measuring something new.

"You're not entirely wrong," Arathen said finally. "But you're also not carrying this alone."

"It feels like I am," Rachel said.

"I know," he said. "That doesn't make it true."

The disagreement hung between them, unresolved.

The tent held itself around them—not quite silent, but filled with the kind of quiet that came from enclosed space and multiple people breathing. Rachel became acutely conscious of proximity. Five people. One impossible space. Every small sound magnified.

She went still, trying not to add to the noise.

"What actually happens when we reach the town?" she asked. "Not the plan you're hoping for. What's realistic?"

Ilyra's expression stayed flat. "Probably not what we want."

"That's honest," Rachel said.

"It's all I have," Ilyra replied.

Edrin spoke without lifting his eyes. "We're hoping they'll be neutral. Neither hostile nor overly helpful."

"That's what you're hoping for?" Rachel asked. "Neutrality?"

Maelin's hands folded together. "Neutral gives us time. Time to plan. Time to understand what you need."

Rachel lay back on the bed, staring at where the ceiling met the wall in a seam that curved impossibly. The tent didn't feel dangerous. But it didn't feel like safety either. It felt like a held breath that couldn't be sustained indefinitely.

"Will they know what I am?" she asked quietly. "The people in the town?"

Silence stretched before anyone answered.

"Know in what sense?" Maelin asked, voice careful.

Rachel's throat tightened. "Will they recognize me as something they have words for?"

Arathen shifted his position slightly. "I don't think anyone has words for you yet. Including us."

The admission didn't comfort her.

Rachel closed her eyes, listening to the small sounds that filled the space—fabric moving as someone adjusted position, breath held a moment too long, the tent itself creaking slightly as it responded to weight and movement.

"All right," she said finally. "Then that's what we're working with."

No one contradicted her.

The light began to fade—not abruptly, but gradually, as if the space itself had decided that day was finished. Someone shifted into sleeping position. Someone else turned to face the wall. The knife remained where Ilyra had set it.

Rachel lay awake longer than the others, awareness tracking beyond the tent's impossible boundaries. The road waited outside, patient and indifferent. The map lay folded somewhere nearby, its routes shifting even while no one looked at it. The Near March continued its slow breathing in the distance.

Inside the tent, nothing demanded her attention or her response.

That should have let her rest.

Instead, she remained alert, body refusing to accept that stopping meant safety.

She'd stopped moving for now.

That was all she could say with certainty.
