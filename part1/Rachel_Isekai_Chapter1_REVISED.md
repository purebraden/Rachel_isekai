# Chapter One

Rachel Mercer’s life was fine.

That was the word she used when people asked, the kind that did a lot of work while pretending not to. Fine meant a job that didn’t make her cry in the bathroom and friends who texted her memes at midnight and a boyfriend who brought her fries when she said she wasn’t hungry. Fine meant rent paid on time, groceries in the fridge, a car that started on the first try.

Fine also meant she could go three, sometimes four days without thinking about where she came from.

Literally.

“Adopted” was the word people used like it wrapped things up. Like it closed a door instead of pointing to another one behind it. Rachel had been adopted as an infant. Closed records. Dates and signatures. A thin place where a story should have been.

Her parents—the ones who raised her—were good people. Kind. Middle-class in the way that meant stability and quiet expectations. Love had never been the issue. They still texted too often. Her dad still forwarded articles about tires and car maintenance, as if one day she might wake up interested in rotating her own tires. Her mom still asked about vitamins.

Most days, the blank spot stayed quiet. On others, it turned into a small, hard thing she carried around with her. You could walk with it. Function around it. Forget it entirely until you shifted wrong and felt the pressure.

That morning, the pressure showed up while she waited in line at the coffee place near her office.

Three people ahead of her. One behind. All of them deeply invested in milk alternatives. The barista asked a question. The woman in front of Rachel answered like she’d been challenged. An apology followed, practiced and weary. Rachel stared at the menu board even though she could recite it.

Her order came out the same as always. No follow-up questions. That felt like a small mercy.

Outside, the cup warmed her hands as she walked back toward the building. Somewhere between the curb and the revolving door, the thought slipped in the way it sometimes did—already settled by the time she noticed it.

I’m missing something.

It wasn’t a thing you could name or schedule or buy. More like everything had been assembled correctly and one essential piece had never been included in the box.

Vague thoughts annoyed her more than sad ones. You couldn’t argue with them. You couldn’t prove them wrong. You couldn’t even say them out loud without sounding like someone who captioned photos with lowercase letters and feelings.

Coffee helped. Or at least the ritual of it did.

Six floors up, the office tried very hard to pretend it wasn’t an office. Exposed brick. Plants that required attention. Artwork chosen by committee, all edges sanded down. The elevator smelled faintly of cleaning solution and someone else’s cologne. Rachel liked the building. She liked the security guard who nodded at her like he recognized her as harmless.

Work was work.

Emails stacked up. A calendar filled itself. A message from her manager started with Quick question and went on long enough to require scrolling. Replies were sent. Notes were taken. A sticky note went up on the edge of her monitor because if it didn’t, the thought attached to it would drift away and come back later when she least wanted it to.

At ten fifteen, Mara texted a picture of a dog wearing sunglasses with the caption you at 3pm. Laughter slipped out before Rachel could stop it. She glanced around her cubicle, checking to see if anyone had heard. No one looked up. That could be read a few different ways.

By eleven, she was in a conference room nodding through a conversation about timelines. Notes filled a page. Agreement happened before she’d fully thought it through. Later would deal with it. Later always did.

The phone buzzed as she left the room.

Evan: Dinner tonight? I can pick up Thai.

The message got more attention than it deserved, like it might contain instructions. Evan was Evan. Kind. Reliable. Too comfortable letting Rachel decide everything. Some days that felt like freedom. Other days it felt like floating.

Yes. Thank you.

The thank you disappeared, then reappeared. A smiley face followed, polite and slightly dishonest.

Another buzz.

Evan: Cool. You okay?

A frown pulled at her mouth. She hadn’t said anything strange. No clipped replies. No emotional tells.

Yeah. Just busy.

A pause.

Evan: Okay. Miss you.

That landed heavier than expected. Sweet. Familiar. Real.

Miss you too.

Her hands stayed on the keyboard longer than necessary. The missing feeling brushed past again, quick and light as a draft.

The bathroom break was mostly an excuse to interrupt her own thoughts.

In the mirror, she looked like herself. Mid-twenties. Brown hair she always meant to do something with and never did. Tired eyes that made her look more serious than she felt. A crease between her eyebrows that showed up when she concentrated and refused to leave.

Cold water helped. A quiet get a grip helped a little more.

The afternoon passed in manageable pieces. Tasks completed. Small annoyances absorbed. Laughter slipped in now and then like cracks in the routine. At five thirty, the laptop shut. A bag went over her shoulder. The elevator ride down included two people who smelled like cologne and one who smelled like new carpet.

Outside, evening air reset something in her chest. The car unlocked with a chirp. She got in and rested her hands on the steering wheel for a moment before turning the key.

That pause was a habit. She’d never questioned it.

Traffic moved. The radio played something unfamiliar. Sunlight flared low through the windshield.

Evan appeared in her mind carrying takeout bags, knocking with his elbow, smiling like he expected praise. A smile showed up on her face without permission.

Her brain followed it with something less helpful: If you disappeared, he’d be the one who had to tell everyone.

The thought tightened her grip on the wheel. Tired explained it. Hungry explained it. An overdramatic brain explained it.

The light turned red. The car idled. People crossed the street. The quiet sense of misalignment returned, like the wrong soundtrack playing under an otherwise normal scene.

Green.

Pressure built in her ears first, the elevator kind that usually cleared if she swallowed, except this time it didn’t, and the air inside the car started to feel wrong, heavier somehow, close enough that her own breathing sounded too loud.

A glance at the dashboard didn’t help. Speed steady. Fuel low. Radio still playing.

The right lane felt safer, so she signaled and eased over, fingers tingling against the steering wheel as if her nerves were waking up in slow motion, pins and needles spreading outward while she told herself—out loud, because that usually helped—that she was fine.

Edges sharpened instead. Lane lines too bright. Taillights too red.

The radio cut off in the middle of a note, and for a second she thought her ears had finally given up, because the silence that followed wasn’t just quiet, it was complete, the kind that pressed in from all sides and made her aware of her own pulse.

Rachel opened her mouth to shout and didn’t hear anything at all.

Then the steering wheel was gone.

There wasn’t time to understand that. Just the sudden, sick drop in her stomach, hands grasping for something that wasn’t there anymore, her body pitching forward as gravity seemed to forget what it was supposed to be doing.

Stone came up fast.

The impact knocked the breath out of her, pain flaring through her palms and shoulder as the world slammed back together all at once—sound rushing in, light stinging, air tasting like dust and something faintly burnt.

She gasped and rolled onto her side, coughing, trying to get enough air while her heart hammered hard enough to make her chest ache.

Cold stone pressed against her cheek.

Pale lines carved into the floor swam into focus, forming a wide circle around her, fractured in places as if whatever had been drawn there had been pushed too far and hadn’t survived it.

Voices reached her through the ringing in her ears.

No—

Oh.

Rachel forced herself up on one elbow and froze.

Three people stood beyond the circle.

Boots. Practical clothes. A lantern tipped on its side. Papers spilling from a satchel.

They stared at her like she was an equation that didn’t balance.

“Oh,” one woman said. “Oh no.”

Her heart hammered. One elbow under her, Rachel pushed up.

“Hi,” she said. “Where am I?”

The man blinked. “That’s… a good question.”

The third woman watched her differently, gaze hovering just off Rachel’s outline, searching for something she couldn’t quite see.

Hands open, the woman with the satchel stopped at the edge of the circle. “You’re not hurt, are you?”

A laugh burst out of Rachel, sharp and breathless. “I was driving.”

“Yes,” the woman said, like that explained things.

“You shouldn’t be here,” the third woman said.

“I know,” Rachel replied, because it was the only honest thing available.

“We were attempting to summon something else,” the man said.

“What else?”

The answer came carefully. “A demon.”

Something clicked.

The air felt closer. Full.

The man’s grip tightened on his book. The third woman’s eyes sharpened.

“Oh,” the woman with the satchel whispered.

Rachel looked down at her hands. Still hers. Scraped. Dirty.

“You got the wrong person.”

The third woman tilted her head. “We don’t think we did.”

Cold stone. Broken circle. Three strangers watching her like the ritual had finally started making sense.

Home felt very far away.

So did the version of herself who’d been content without knowing why.

Whatever she’d been missing had stopped hovering at the edge of her life.

It was here.

She just didn’t know yet whether it had arrived as a gift or a trap.
