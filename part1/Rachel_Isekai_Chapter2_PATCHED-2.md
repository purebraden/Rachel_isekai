# Chapter Two

Rachel stayed on the floor longer than she needed to.

Pain explained some of it—shoulder, palms, the sharp reminders left behind by a fall. The rest came from the way the three of them moved around her with deliberate care: voices kept low, steps measured, hands hovering like they were trying to be helpful without making her bolt. Standing felt like a decision. She wasn’t ready to make decisions yet.

If she’d been drugged, the world should have felt softer. Blurred. Slower.

Instead, everything arrived in crisp detail.

Thoughts lined up neatly instead of drifting. Pain came clean and exact, a bright point in her shoulder, a sting in each palm. Even the cold stone under her hip registered clearly, every groove and grit line insisting on being counted.

That didn’t match the story her brain wanted to tell.

Maelin offered water again.

She held the cup with both hands—steady, careful, like she was handing Rachel something fragile. Ceramic. Warm. Ordinary in a way that felt practiced.

“Thank you,” Rachel said automatically, because politeness was a habit and habits were anchors.

The water tasted like water. Cold. Plain. Her throat accepted it gratefully. Her pulse stayed steady, its rhythm sharp in her ears.

Awake. Too awake.

The stone pressed through her jeans. She shifted with a quiet hiss. Edrin noticed immediately and crouched nearby, hovering without touching her, hands braced awkwardly on his knees.

“There’s a bench,” he said. “If that’s easier.”

Rachel followed his gaze. Wooden. Plain. Close enough that getting there wouldn’t turn into a performance.

“I can walk,” she said—and meant it.

Standing took effort, but her balance caught itself faster than she expected. The room tilted for half a second and then settled, like her body corrected before her mind finished issuing the command. Maelin stepped forward on instinct and then stopped, catching herself mid-motion.

Rachel clocked that pause. The way Maelin didn’t want to crowd her. The way she also didn’t want Rachel moving too freely.

She walked to the bench and sat. The wood creaked softly. A folded cloth appeared beside her without ceremony. Rachel used it, wiping dust and grit from her palms, noticing how quickly the sting eased once the dirt was gone.

Names happened, as if everyone collectively decided this was the moment to behave like regular people.

Maelin. Edrin. Ilyra.

Rachel repeated them back, tasting the syllables, filing them away. Memory felt crisp too, edges sharpened.

“I’m Rachel,” she said. “Rachel Mercer.”

First name. Last name. Still hers.

Edrin nodded, earnest. “We’re really sorry,” he said, like repetition might rewind the moment. “This wasn’t meant to happen.”

“I figured,” Rachel said.

Maelin winced. “Right. Yes.”

They hovered—apologetic, concerned, human.

Which made the situation worse, not better.

Rachel waited for the other shoe. Instructions. A demand. A threat. Something to make this fit the kidnapping model her brain kept assembling.

Nothing came.

Her shoulder throbbed in time with her heartbeat, each pulse distinct. The room smelled like stone and oil and something faintly metallic. Her eyes kept moving on their own, cataloging exits, distances, body positions, the fact that none of them stood directly between her and the doorway.

The clarity bothered her more than the pain did. She should be in shock—foggy, disoriented, struggling to process. Instead, her thoughts lined up sharp and ordered, her senses heightened in a way that felt less like adrenaline and more like waking up.

She pushed the observation away. Trauma did strange things to people.

"So," she said, because silence was starting to feel dangerous. "What happens now?"

The three of them exchanged quick looks. Ilyra tilted her head slightly. Edrin rubbed his face like he’d already answered this in his head ten times and disliked every version.

“Well,” Maelin said carefully, “first we make sure you’re all right.”

“I think I am,” Rachel said. “Mostly.”

“And then,” Edrin added, “we slow things down.”

Her stomach tightened. “From what?”

“From cascading,” he said, then caught himself. “That sounded—”

“Bad,” Rachel supplied.

His mouth twitched, apologetic. “Yes.”

Her purse was gone. Phone, keys, wallet—everything that tied her to the day she’d been having. Gone with the car. That absence pressed on her harder than the pain did.

Evan would be checking his phone by now.

The thought landed heavy. He would have texted. Once, then again. He worried quietly but thoroughly.

Rachel lifted her chin a fraction. “I need to let someone know where I am.”

Maelin leaned forward at once. “Of course.”

“My boyfriend,” Rachel said. “He’s expecting me.”

Edrin nodded immediately. “That makes sense.”

“Yes,” Maelin said. “Absolutely.”

They didn’t say how.

Rachel let the silence stretch, watching to see if it would turn into a plan.

It didn’t.

Ilyra filled it instead, voice calm in a way that made Rachel’s skin prickle. “Time doesn’t always behave the way people expect.”

Rachel’s breath caught. “What does that mean?”

“Sometimes it stretches,” Ilyra said. “Sometimes it… doesn’t line up.”

“That’s not reassuring,” Rachel said.

“No,” Ilyra agreed. “It isn’t.”

Rachel forced herself to inhale slowly, counting the breath like she’d learned in some mandatory work seminar she’d pretended to hate. Panic wouldn’t help. Calm might.

“Is there a way I can send a message?” she asked. “Just to say I’m okay.”

Maelin’s expression softened. Genuinely. “We’ll see what we can do.”

Rachel nodded.

That answer was a bridge made of fog. Still, she stepped onto it.

Time passed without announcing itself.

Food appeared—bread still warm, soup that smelled rich and comforting. Rachel ate because her body demanded it and because refusing felt like escalation. Taste registered sharply, every herb distinct, every swallow clean. Her stomach settled. Her mind stayed clear.

The wrongness sharpened.

If she’d been drugged, she would feel distant from her own body. Slower. Fuzzier around the edges.

She felt fast.

After that, they asked her to move to a smaller room. Asked, not told. The space was simple: a cot, a table, a cup of water waiting. The door stayed ajar.

"Just until we understand more," Edrin said. "You're free to move around. We just like to know where you are."

Rachel smiled, easy and practiced. "Sure."

The smile came easier than it should have. She was being held—however gently—by people who'd pulled her from her life, and yet some part of her had already started calculating how to make this work instead of how to escape.

That wasn't right.

Even while she smiled, her attention tracked the doorway. The distance to the hall. The sound of footsteps beyond. The way her hearing seemed tuned slightly too high, as if the world had turned its volume up.

Stone and clean fabric made up the room’s smell. Rachel sat on the cot and pressed her hands into the mattress, grounding herself in pressure and texture.

Her phone should have buzzed by now.

Evan would be pacing. He hated uncertainty. She could picture it: that specific way he moved when he was worried, hands rubbing the back of his neck, wearing a path in the carpet. He'd done it the night she'd gotten food poisoning, walking circles around her apartment while she insisted she was fine, coming back every ten minutes to check if she needed anything.

"I've got you," he'd said, voice soft and certain, holding her hair back when fine turned into not-fine. "Just let me help."

She'd let him that night. Let him see her small and sick and helpless. And he'd been nothing but gentle about it.

The memory should have been warm. Comforting. Instead it just made her chest ache.

She tried to picture him now—really picture him, the specific way his mouth pulled tight when he was stressed, the gray T-shirt he wore when he was having a bad day—and the image came slower than it should have. Blurrier. Like trying to remember someone through fog.

That wrongness jolted her awake in a way fear hadn't.

How long had it been since she'd thought of him? Hours? Since she'd arrived? She'd been cataloging exits and accepting food and calculating how to survive, and somewhere in all of that, Evan—gentle, patient Evan who'd held her hair back and never asked for anything in return—had slipped to the back of her mind like something she'd deal with later.

The emotion hit fast and full—fear, irritation, grief, guilt—stacked without warning. She swallowed, startled by the force of it.

This isn’t shock, she realized. This is clarity.

The thought landed heavy.

Everything felt sharpened, emotions arriving clean and hard, awareness stretched tight around her like a net. The drugged explanation—her best, most human explanation—crumbled in her hands.

Rachel lay back and stared at the stone ceiling, at the uneven pattern of blocks fitted together with a care she couldn’t quite name. Her mind kept reaching for a human reason and coming back empty.

I’ll explain later, she caught herself thinking.

The habit made her stomach twist.

Explain what? To who? And how did you explain feeling more awake than you’d ever felt to the person you loved?

Sounds drifted through the doorway—voices, footsteps, the quiet continuity of people living their lives while hers hung suspended.

Rachel turned onto her side and faced the door.

Breathing stayed slow. Expression stayed neutral. Thoughts stayed private.

Going along with this remained the safest option.

But now she knew what she was doing: buying time, not waiting for rescue.

Underneath the fear, beneath the sharpened awareness, something else stirred—warm, present, unmistakably hers.

Rachel didn’t reach for it.

Not yet.
