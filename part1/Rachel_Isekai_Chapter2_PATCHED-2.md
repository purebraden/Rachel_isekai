## Chapter Two

Rachel stayed on the floor longer than she needed to.

Pain explained some of it—shoulder, palms, the reminders left behind by a fall. The rest came from the way the three of them moved around her with deliberate care: voices kept low, steps measured, hands hovering like they were trying to be helpful without making her bolt. Standing felt like a decision. She wasn't ready to make decisions yet.

Something felt wrong, though. Not dangerous-wrong. Just... off.

If she'd been drugged—which seemed like the most logical explanation for appearing in a stone room with three strangers—the world should have felt softer. Blurred. Distant. Instead, everything arrived sharp and clear. Thoughts lined up neatly. Pain registered precise and exact. Even the cold stone beneath her felt impossibly present, every texture insisting on being noticed.

She was more awake than she'd been in months. Maybe years.

That didn't match any story her brain wanted to tell.

The woman with the satchel offered water again.

She held the cup with both hands—steady, careful, like she was handing Rachel something fragile. Ceramic. Warm. Ordinary in a way that felt practiced.

"Thank you," Rachel said automatically, because politeness was a habit and habits were anchors.

The water tasted like water. Cold. Plain. Her throat accepted it gratefully.

The stone pressed through her jeans. She shifted with a quiet hiss. The man noticed immediately and crouched nearby, hovering without touching her, hands braced awkwardly on his knees.

“There’s a bench,” he said. “If that’s easier.”

Rachel followed his gaze. Wooden. Plain. Close enough that getting there wouldn’t turn into a performance.

“I can walk,” she said—and meant it.

Standing took effort, but her balance caught itself faster than she expected. The room tilted for half a second and then settled, like her body corrected before her mind finished issuing the command. The woman stepped forward on instinct and then stopped, catching herself mid-motion.

Rachel clocked that pause. The way she didn't want to crowd her. The way she also didn't want Rachel moving too freely.

She walked to the bench and sat. The wood creaked softly. A folded cloth appeared beside her without ceremony. Rachel used it, wiping dust and grit from her palms, noticing how quickly the sting eased once the dirt was gone.

Names happened, as if everyone collectively decided this was the moment to behave like regular people.

The woman with the satchel went first. "I'm Maelin," she said, voice gentle but firm.

The man followed. "Edrin."

The third woman, the one who'd been watching Rachel with that odd intensity, said simply, "Ilyra."

Rachel repeated them back, tasting the syllables, filing them away. Maelin. Edrin. Ilyra.

"I'm Rachel," she said. "Rachel Mercer."

First name. Last name. Still hers.

Edrin nodded, earnest. "We're really sorry," he said, like repetition might rewind the moment. "This wasn't meant to happen."

“I figured,” Rachel said.

Maelin winced. “Right. Yes.”

They hovered—apologetic, concerned, human.

Which made the situation worse, not better.

Rachel waited for the other shoe. Instructions. A demand. A threat. Something to make this fit the kidnapping model her brain kept assembling.

Nothing came.

Her shoulder throbbed in time with her heartbeat. The room smelled like stone and oil and something faintly metallic. Her eyes kept moving on their own, cataloging exits, distances, body positions, the fact that none of them stood directly between her and the doorway.

"So," she said, because silence was starting to feel dangerous. "What happens now?"

The three of them exchanged quick looks. Ilyra tilted her head slightly. Edrin rubbed his face like he’d already answered this in his head ten times and disliked every version.

“Well,” Maelin said carefully, “first we make sure you’re all right.”

“I think I am,” Rachel said. “Mostly.”

“And then,” Edrin added, “we slow things down.”

Her stomach tightened. “From what?”

“From cascading,” he said, then caught himself. “That sounded—”

“Bad,” Rachel supplied.

His mouth twitched, apologetic. “Yes.”

Her purse was gone. Phone, keys, wallet—everything that tied her to the day she’d been having. Gone with the car. That absence pressed on her harder than the pain did.

Evan would be checking his phone by now.

The thought landed heavy. He would have texted. Once, then again. He worried quietly but thoroughly.

Rachel lifted her chin a fraction. “I need to let someone know where I am.”

Maelin leaned forward at once. “Of course.”

“My boyfriend,” Rachel said. “He’s expecting me.”

Edrin nodded immediately. “That makes sense.”

“Yes,” Maelin said. “Absolutely.”

They didn’t say how.

Rachel let the silence stretch, watching to see if it would turn into a plan.

It didn’t.

Ilyra filled it instead, voice calm in a way that made Rachel's skin prickle. "Time doesn't always behave the way people expect."

Rachel's breath caught. "What does that mean?"

"Sometimes it stretches," Ilyra said. "Sometimes it… doesn't line up. A day here might be an hour there. Or a week. The boundaries don't keep consistent time."

Rachel stared at her. "Boundaries. You keep saying that. What boundaries?"

The three of them went still.

"Where am I?" Rachel asked, voice sharper now. "And don't say a region or a place name I won't recognize. Where. Am. I."

Maelin's hands folded together. "Not where you were."

"I figured that out when I fell through my steering wheel," Rachel said. "But I'm still on Earth, right? This is just—some remote area, or a military facility, or—"

"No," Edrin said quietly.

The word hung in the air.

Rachel's chest tightened. "No what?"

"You're not on Earth," Maelin said gently. "I'm sorry. This isn't your world."

The room tilted. Not like before, not like magic—just the normal way the world tilted when it stopped making sense.

"That's not possible," Rachel said.

No one argued with her.

"That's—" She stood, paced two steps, stopped. "You're saying I'm on another planet? Like, in space?"

"Not exactly," Edrin said carefully. "Not another planet in your universe. Another world entirely. Parallel, maybe, or layered—we don't fully understand the mechanics. But separate."

Rachel's laugh came out sharp and broken. "You don't understand the mechanics of the impossible thing you just told me is real."

"Yes," he admitted.

She wanted to argue. Wanted to demand proof, evidence, something rational. But she'd already fallen through reality once today. And these people, with their strange clothes and careful words, weren't lying. She could feel that much.

"How long has it been?" Rachel asked finally, voice hollow. "Back there. In my—" The word stuck in her throat. "In my world."

Maelin and Edrin exchanged glances.

"We don't know," Edrin admitted quietly. "There's no way to measure it from this side."

Rachel's stomach twisted. Somewhere, in another world—her world—people she loved might think she was dead. Might have already grieved her. And there was nothing she could do about it.

"Is there a way I can send a message?" she asked, voice tight. "Just to say I'm okay."

Maelin's expression softened. Genuinely. "We'll see what we can do. I'm sorry we can't give you better answers."

Rachel nodded, throat too tight to speak.

That answer was a bridge made of fog. Still, she stepped onto it.

Time passed without announcing itself.

Food appeared—bread still warm, soup that smelled rich and comforting. Rachel ate because her body demanded it and because refusing felt like escalation. Her stomach settled.

After that, they asked her to move to a smaller room. Asked, not told. The space was simple: a cot, a table, a cup of water waiting. The door stayed ajar.

"Just until we understand more," Edrin said. "You're free to move around. We just like to know where you are."

Rachel smiled, easy and practiced. "Sure."

The smile came easier than it should have. She was being held—however gently—by people who'd pulled her from her life, and yet some part of her had already started calculating how to make this work instead of how to escape.

That wasn't right.

Even while she smiled, her attention tracked the doorway. The distance to the hall. The sound of footsteps beyond. The way her hearing seemed tuned slightly too high, as if the world had turned its volume up.

Stone and clean fabric made up the room's smell. Rachel sat on the cot and pressed her hands into the mattress, grounding herself in pressure and texture.

Her phone should have buzzed by now.

The thought arrived with uncomfortable clarity. Evan would have texted when she didn't show up for dinner. Then called. Then texted again. By now he'd be pacing his apartment, hands rubbing the back of his neck, that specific restless motion he did when he worried.

He hated uncertainty. Always had. When she'd gotten food poisoning last year, he'd worn a path in her carpet, circling back every ten minutes to check if she needed anything even though she kept insisting she was fine.

"I've got you," he'd said, voice soft and certain, holding her hair back when fine turned into not-fine. "Just let me help."

She'd let him that night. Let him see her small and sick and helpless. And he'd been nothing but gentle about it.

The memory should have been warm. Comforting. Instead it just made her chest ache.

She tried to picture him now—really picture him, the specific way his mouth pulled tight when he was stressed, the gray T-shirt he wore when he was having a bad day—and the image came slower than it should have. Blurrier. Like trying to remember someone through fog.

That wrongness jolted her awake in a way fear hadn't.

How long had it been since she'd thought of him? Hours? Since she'd arrived? She'd been cataloging exits and accepting food and calculating how to survive, and somewhere in all of that, Evan—gentle, patient Evan who'd held her hair back and never asked for anything in return—had slipped to the back of her mind like something she'd deal with later.

The guilt hit fast. Sharp. Real.

Rachel lay back and stared at the stone ceiling, at the uneven pattern of blocks fitted together with a care she couldn't quite name. Her mind kept reaching for a rational explanation and coming back empty.

Sounds drifted through the doorway—voices, footsteps, the quiet continuity of people living their lives while hers hung suspended.

Rachel turned onto her side and faced the door.

Breathing stayed slow. Expression stayed neutral. Thoughts stayed private.

Underneath the fear, something else stirred—warm, present, unmistakably hers.

She pressed her hand against her chest and felt it pulse there, waiting.
