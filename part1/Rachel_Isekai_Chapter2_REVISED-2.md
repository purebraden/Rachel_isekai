# Chapter Two

Rachel stayed on the floor longer than she needed to.

Pain explained some of it—shoulder, palms, the sharp reminders left behind by a fall. The rest came from the way the three of them moved around her with deliberate care: voices kept low, steps measured, hands hovering like they were trying to be helpful without making her bolt. Standing felt like a decision. She wasn’t ready to make decisions yet.

If she’d been drugged, the world should have felt softer. Blurred. Slower.

Instead, everything came in crisp.

Thoughts lined up neatly instead of drifting. Pain arrived clean and exact, a bright point in her shoulder, a sting in each palm. Even the cold stone under her hip registered in detail, every groove and grit line.

That didn’t match the story her brain wanted to tell.

Maelin offered water again.

She held the cup with both hands—steady, careful, like she was handing Rachel a fragile object. Ceramic. Warm. Ordinary in a way that felt practiced.

“Thank you,” Rachel said automatically, because politeness was a habit and habits were anchors.

The water tasted like water. Cold. Plain. Her throat accepted it gratefully. Her pulse stayed steady, its rhythm sharp in her ears.

Awake. Too awake.

The stone pressed through her jeans. She shifted with a quiet hiss. Edrin noticed immediately and crouched nearby, hovering without touching her, hands braced awkwardly on his knees.

“There’s a bench,” he said. “If that’s easier.”

Rachel followed his gaze. Wooden. Plain. Close enough that getting there wouldn’t turn into a performance.

“I can walk,” she said—and meant it.

Standing took effort, but her balance caught itself faster than she expected. The room tilted for half a second and then settled, like her body corrected before her mind finished issuing the command. Maelin stepped forward on instinct and then stopped, catching herself mid-motion.

Rachel clocked that pause. The way Maelin didn’t want to crowd her. The way she also didn’t want Rachel moving too freely.

She walked to the bench and sat. The wood creaked softly. A folded cloth appeared beside her without ceremony. Rachel used it, wiping dust and grit from her palms, noticing how quickly the sting eased once the dirt was gone.

Names happened, as if everyone collectively decided this was the moment to behave like regular people.

Maelin. Edrin. Ilyra.

Rachel repeated them back, tasting the syllables and filing them away. Memory felt crisp too, edges sharpened.

“I’m Rachel,” she said. “Rachel Mercer.”

First name. Last name. Still hers.

Edrin nodded, earnest. “We’re really sorry,” he said, like repetition might rewind the moment. “This wasn’t meant to happen.”

“I figured,” Rachel said.

Maelin winced. “Right. Yes.”

They hovered—apologetic, concerned, human.

Which made the situation worse, not better.

Rachel waited for the other shoe. Instructions. A demand. A threat. Something to make this fit the kidnapping model her brain was building.

Nothing came.

Her shoulder throbbed in time with her heartbeat, each pulse distinct. The room smelled like stone and oil and something faintly metallic. Her eyes kept moving on their own, cataloging exits, distances, body positions, the fact that none of them stood directly between her and the doorway.

“So,” she said, because silence was stretching thin. “What happens now?”

The three of them exchanged quick looks. Ilyra tilted her head slightly. Edrin rubbed his face like he’d already answered this in his head ten times and disliked every version.

“Well,” Maelin said carefully, “first we make sure you’re all right.”

“I think I am,” Rachel said. “Mostly.”

“And then,” Edrin added, “we slow things down.”

Her stomach tightened. “From what?”

“From cascading,” he said, then caught himself. “That sounded—”

“Bad,” Rachel supplied.

His mouth twitched, apologetic. “Yes.”

Her purse was gone. Phone, keys, wallet—everything that tied her to the day she’d been having. Gone with the car. That absence pressed on her harder than the pain did.

Evan would be checking his phone by now.

The thought landed like a weight. He would have texted. Once, then again. He worried quietly but thoroughly.

Rachel lifted her chin a fraction. “I need to let someone know where I am.”

Maelin leaned forward, attentive. “Of course.”

“My boyfriend,” Rachel said. “He’s expecting me.”

Edrin nodded immediately. “That makes sense.”

“Yes,” Maelin said. “Absolutely.”

They didn’t say how.

Rachel held the silence for a beat, waiting to see if anyone would fill it with a plan.

Ilyra did instead, voice calm in a way that made Rachel’s skin prickle. “Time doesn’t always behave the way people expect.”

Rachel’s breath caught, sharp and fast. “What does that mean?”

“Sometimes it stretches,” Ilyra said. “Sometimes it… doesn’t line up.”

“That’s not reassuring,” Rachel said.

“No,” Ilyra agreed. “It isn’t.”

Rachel forced herself to inhale slowly, counting the breath like she’d learned in some work seminar she’d rolled her eyes at. Panic wouldn’t help. Calm might.

“Is there a way I can send a message?” she asked. “Just to say I’m okay.”

Maelin’s expression softened. Genuinely. “We’ll see what we can do.”

Rachel nodded.

That answer was a bridge made of fog. Still, she took it.

Time passed without announcing itself.

Food appeared—bread still warm, soup that smelled rich and comforting. Rachel ate because her body demanded it and because refusing felt like escalation. Taste registered sharply, every herb distinct, every swallow clean. Her stomach settled. Her mind stayed clear.

The wrongness sharpened.

If she’d been drugged, she would feel distant from her own body. Slower. Fuzzier around the edges.

She felt fast.

After that, they asked her to move to a smaller room. Asked, not told. The space was simple: a cot, a table, a cup of water waiting. The door stayed ajar.

“Just until we understand more,” Edrin said. “You’re free to move around. We just like to know where you are.”

Rachel smiled, easy and practiced. “Sure.”

Even while she smiled, her attention tracked the doorway. The distance to the hall. The sound of footsteps beyond. The way her own hearing seemed tuned slightly too high, as if the world had turned its volume up.

Stone and clean fabric made up the room’s smell. Rachel sat on the cot and pressed her hands into the mattress, grounding herself in pressure and texture.

Her phone should have buzzed by now.

Evan would be pacing. He hated uncertainty. He would be weighing whether to call Mara, whether to call her parents, whether to drive to her apartment and check the parking lot like that would produce her out of thin air.

The emotion hit fast and full—grief, fear, irritation—stacked together without the usual ramp-up. She swallowed, startled by the force of it.

This isn’t shock, she realized. This is clarity.

The thought landed heavy.

Everything felt sharpened, emotions arriving clean and hard, awareness stretched tight around her like a net. The drugged explanation—her best, most human explanation—crumbled in her hands.

Rachel lay back and stared at the stone ceiling, at the uneven pattern of blocks fitted together with a care she couldn’t quite parse. Her mind kept reaching for a human reason and coming back empty.

I’ll explain later, she caught herself thinking.

The habit startled her.

Explain what? To who? And how did you explain feeling more awake than you’d ever felt in your life to the person you loved?

Sounds drifted through the doorway—voices, footsteps, the quiet continuity of people living their lives while hers hung suspended.

Rachel turned onto her side and faced the door.

Breathing stayed slow. Expression stayed neutral. Thoughts stayed private.

Going along with this remained the safest option.

But now she knew what she was doing: buying time, not waiting for rescue.

Underneath the fear, beneath the sharpened awareness, something else stirred—warm, present, unmistakably hers.

Rachel didn’t reach for it.

Not yet.
