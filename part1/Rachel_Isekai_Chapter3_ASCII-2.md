## Chapter Three

Hunger woke Rachel fully.

It sat low and steady, insistent enough to pull her upright before she had time to think about it. She stayed seated on the edge of the cot for a moment, feet planted, one hand pressed to her chest where that strange warmth had pulsed the night before.

Nothing now. Just her heartbeat, steady and ordinary.

She'd lain awake for a long time after feeling it, that presence beneath her ribs—warm and waiting and impossibly hers. Eventually exhaustion had pulled her under, but her dreams had been restless, full of falling and catching herself mid-air, of reaching for things that moved away from her fingers.

Rachel dropped her hand and listened to the building around her, letting the shape of the morning settle.

Voices carried from somewhere down the corridor. One rose, another answered. A pause. Footsteps crossed stone, slow and unhurried. Wood scraped against the floor, then stopped. The sounds repeated with small variations, a pattern forming without rushing, like the place itself had learned how to breathe.

Rachel stood.

Her balance came easily. Too easily. The ache in her shoulder answered at once when she shifted, precise enough to locate down to the inch. She waited for the fog that usually followed a bad night, the dull drag behind the eyes.

Nothing followed.

The doorway opened onto the corridor without resistance. Rachel stepped through and let the doorframe pass behind her. The floor cooled the soles of her shoes. Light stayed even along the walls, neither brightening nor dimming as she moved, as if the space had decided what it was and didn't intend to change its mind.

She followed the sound of voices.

The corridor widened into a shared room. A long table filled most of the space, its surface already in use. Plates clustered near one end. A pitcher waited beside them, moisture gathering along the glass. Steam rose from a pot near the center, drifting upward before thinning out and vanishing.

Maelin stood at the table, placing plates one by one. Edrin sat on a bench nearby, sleeves rolled, attention fixed on a ledger balanced across his knees. Ilyra leaned against the far wall, weight on one foot, gaze moving between the room and the corridor Rachel had just come from.

Maelin noticed her first.

Her hands slowed, then resumed. "Good morning."

"Morning," Rachel said. She stopped just inside the room, giving herself a second to take it in.

Maelin waited a beat. "You're welcome to eat."

Rachel nodded and moved closer.

Edrin looked up as she reached the table. "Did you sleep?"

"I think so," Rachel said. It felt true enough.

He dipped his head once and returned to the page.

Rachel poured water from the pitcher. The glass clinked softly as she set it down. She drank. Cold spread across her tongue and down her throat, sharp and grounding.

Conversation resumed around her without shifting direction.

Maelin asked Edrin about a delivery. He answered without looking up. Ilyra spoke once, briefly, and Maelin turned toward her immediately before responding. Rachel listened to the timing more than the words, the way attention moved.

She tore a piece of bread free and ate. The crust cracked between her fingers. Chewing took longer than she expected, as if her body wanted confirmation before letting the food disappear.

Her eyes kept moving.

One doorway opened back into the corridor. Another sat partially covered by a hanging cloth. Edrin's bench gave him a clear view of both. Ilyra's position did the same. Maelin worked with her back to the table only when both of the others were facing it.

Rachel set her cup down.

"Did anyone find my phone?" she asked.

Maelin answered without stopping what she was doing. "We looked. It wasn't with your other things."

Rachel nodded and reached for more bread.

Edrin shifted on the bench, adjusting the ledger against his knee. "We'll keep trying."

Ilyra watched Rachel as she ate. Her gaze moved to Rachel's hands, then back to her face, measuring something that didn't have an obvious name.

Rachel noticed the table next. One leg sat shorter than the others. The surface angled slightly toward the far end. Cups clustered closer to Maelin, as if set there out of habit rather than design.

Maelin spoke again. "How are you feeling this morning?"

Rachel swallowed before answering. "Awake."

Maelin smiled faintly. "That's something."

Edrin turned a page.

Ilyra's attention drifted toward the corridor, then returned, sharper than before.

Rachel stayed where she was, eating, listening. Words moved around her without pressing in. The morning continued in small increments--questions answered, objects shifted, footsteps passing the open doorway and moving on.

Rachel rested her palm briefly against the table's edge. Wood met skin. The surface angled away beneath her hand.

She let the moment pass.

Maelin reached for another cup.

She lifted it from the table while speaking, attention angled toward Edrin. Her sleeve caught the edge. The cup tipped.

Water sloshed toward the rim, gravity pulling it down and out. The cup tumbled from her fingers, falling.

Rachel's hand came up without thought.

Stop.

The moment stretched, thin and precise.

The cup hung in the air between Maelin's hand and the floor. Water bulged at the rim, held mid-spill, neither falling nor settling. The drop that should have scattered across the stone simply waited, suspended.

Rachel's breath caught high in her chest. She didn't blink.

Then the room resumed.

The cup continued its fall—but slower now, drifting down like a feather instead of a stone. It touched the floor without breaking, settling upright. The water that should have spilled drew back into the glass as if time had reconsidered.

Everyone in the room had gone still.

Rachel drew her hand back and stared at it. Her palm tingled, warm in a way that had nothing to do with temperature. The sensation felt familiar—disturbingly familiar—like flexing a muscle she'd always had but never known how to use.

Like finding a word in a language she'd never been taught but somehow still understood.

The rightness of it made her stomach turn.

Maelin stood frozen, her hand still outstretched where the cup had been. Her eyes were wide.

Edrin rose slowly from the bench, movements careful, deliberate. The ledger slid forgotten from his lap and scattered across the floor, pages fanning where they landed.

Ilyra's gaze locked on Rachel, unblinking. "What did you just do?"

Rachel pressed her hand against her thigh, trying to erase the warmth. "I didn't touch it," she said, and hated how defensive she sounded.

Maelin's hand slowly lowered. She stared at the cup sitting upright on the floor, water still contained inside as if nothing had happened.

"We saw," she said quietly.

Edrin crouched, gathering the ledger page by page. One corner caught under the bench. He tugged it free and stacked the papers against his knee, movements slow and deliberate.

Ilyra said Rachel's name once. Quietly.

The sound carried across the table and settled.

Rachel swallowed. Her tongue stuck briefly to the roof of her mouth. "It was going to fall."

"Yes," Ilyra said.

Rachel's mouth opened. Closed. Then she straightened, decision forming. "I want to do it again."

Three pairs of eyes fixed on her.

"Rachel—" Maelin started.

"Not a suggestion," Rachel said. The words came out steadier than she felt. "Whatever just happened, it came from me. I need to know if I can control it. You need to know too." She looked between them. "Or were you just going to pretend it didn't happen and hope it doesn't come up again?"

Silence.

"She's not wrong," Ilyra said finally.

Maelin drew a breath. Her hands came together, fingers threading and unthreading. "Are you sure?"

Rachel nodded once. The motion was firm. Decisive.

Edrin finished stacking the ledger and set it down farther from the table than before. He nudged the bench back with his foot, creating space.

The room shifted around Rachel.

Maelin angled her body away from the table. Edrin moved to the side, leaving open space in front of her. Ilyra stayed where she was, weight balanced, attention steady.

Rachel tracked each adjustment.

Her hands curled loosely at her sides. She rubbed her thumb against the side of her finger, feeling a faint tackiness where the table's finish had warmed under her skin. "I didn't want it to spill."

Maelin inclined her head.

Edrin straightened. "We're going to slow things down."

Rachel focused on her breathing. Air moved in. Out. Her pulse steadied enough to count again.

"What does that mean?" she asked.

Maelin answered as she took another step back. "It means you'll have space."

Distance opened without comment. The table no longer pressed at Rachel's side.

Ilyra's gaze softened briefly as Rachel shifted, then settled again.

Rachel rested her palm against the table's edge. The wood angled beneath her hand.

She focused. Tried to remember the feeling—that instinct that had risen when the cup fell. The urgency. The need to stop something bad from happening.

Nothing came.

The table stayed solid beneath her palm. Ordinary. Still.

She waited, hand pressed flat, willing something to happen. A tingle. A warmth. Any sign that whatever she'd done before was still there, still accessible.

The room stayed quiet. Patient.

Rachel's hand dropped. "I can't," she said. "I don't know how I did it the first time."

Maelin stepped closer, voice gentle. "That's all right. We're not in a rush."

"Aren't we?" Rachel's laugh came out hollow. She rubbed her face with both hands. "I need to tell my boyfriend. He's going to be looking for me. My family. My—everyone's going to think I'm dead."

The weight of it hit her all at once. The magic was interesting, frightening, impossible—but Evan was real. And he was out there, somewhere, terrified.

Maelin nodded. "We'll work on that. I promise."

Rachel watched her mouth as she spoke. The pause before the words. The breath afterward.

She didn't press.

The room carried on around her—someone picking up a plate, the pot lid settling back into place, a chair leg scraping before being corrected. Careful movements. Ordinary ones.

Rachel stayed where she was, counting time by the small motions people made when they weren't sure how to proceed.
