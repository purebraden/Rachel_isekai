# Chapter Three

Hunger woke Rachel fully.

It sat low and steady, enough to pull her upright before she thought about it. She stayed seated on the edge of the cot for a moment, feet planted, listening to the building around her.

Voices carried from somewhere down the corridor. One rose, another answered. A pause. Footsteps crossed stone, slow and unhurried. Wood scraped against the floor, then stopped. The sounds repeated with small variations, a pattern forming without rushing.

Rachel stood.

Her balance came easily. The ache in her shoulder answered at once when she shifted, precise enough to locate. She waited for the fog that usually followed a bad night.

Nothing followed.

The doorway opened onto the corridor without resistance. Rachel stepped through and let the doorframe pass behind her. The floor cooled the soles of her shoes. Light stayed even along the walls, neither brightening nor dimming as she moved.

She followed the sound of voices.

The corridor widened into a shared room. A long table filled most of the space, its surface already in use. Plates sat near one end. A pitcher waited beside them, moisture gathering along the glass. Steam rose from a pot near the center, drifting upward before thinning out.

Maelin stood at the table, placing plates one by one. Edrin sat on a bench nearby, sleeves rolled, attention fixed on a ledger across his knees. Ilyra leaned against the far wall, weight on one foot, gaze moving between the room and the corridor Rachel had just come from.

Maelin noticed her first.

Her hands slowed, then resumed. “Good morning.”

“Morning,” Rachel said. She stopped just inside the room.

Maelin waited a beat. “You’re welcome to eat.”

Rachel nodded and moved closer.

Edrin looked up as she reached the table. “Did you sleep?”

“I think so,” Rachel said.

He dipped his head once and returned to the page.

Rachel poured water from the pitcher. The glass clinked softly as she set it down. She drank. Cold spread across her tongue and down her throat.

Conversation resumed around her without shifting direction.

Maelin asked Edrin about a delivery. He answered without looking up. Ilyra spoke once, briefly, and Maelin turned toward her immediately before responding. Rachel listened to the timing more than the words.

She tore a piece of bread free and ate. Crust cracked between her fingers. Chewing took longer than she expected.

Her eyes moved.

One doorway opened back into the corridor. Another sat partially covered by a hanging cloth. Edrin’s bench gave him a clear view of both. Ilyra’s position did the same. Maelin worked with her back to the table only when both of the others were facing it.

Rachel set her cup down.

“Did anyone find my phone?” she asked.

Maelin answered without stopping what she was doing. “We looked. It wasn’t with your other things.”

Rachel nodded and reached for more bread.

Edrin shifted on the bench, adjusting the ledger against his knee. “We’ll keep trying.”

Ilyra watched Rachel as she ate. Her gaze moved to Rachel’s hands, then back to her face.

Rachel noticed the table next. One leg sat shorter than the others. The surface angled slightly toward the far end. Cups clustered closer to Maelin, as if set there out of habit.

Maelin spoke again. “How are you feeling this morning?”

Rachel swallowed before answering. “Awake.”

Maelin smiled. “That’s something.”

Edrin turned a page.

Ilyra’s attention drifted toward the corridor, then returned.

Rachel stayed where she was, eating, listening. Words moved around her without pressing in. The morning continued in small increments—questions answered, objects shifted, footsteps passing the open doorway and moving on.

Rachel rested her palm briefly against the table’s edge. Wood met skin. The surface angled away beneath her hand.

She let the moment pass.

Maelin reached for another cup.

She lifted it from the table while speaking, attention angled toward Edrin. Her sleeve brushed the stack of plates, shifting them a fraction. One scraped softly against the wood. She adjusted it without looking.

Rachel shifted her weight, heel rocking against the stone. The table pressed lightly into her hip. Warmth from the pot drifted up and settled against her forearms.

The table slanted.

The cup shifted in Maelin’s hand.

Rachel’s fingers lifted from the table edge.

The moment stretched.

Water crept along the rim of the cup, bulging outward. A drop formed and held. Somewhere in the corridor, a footstep landed half a beat late, then finished.

Rachel’s breath stayed caught at the top of her chest.

Then the room resumed.

Maelin’s fingers stayed on the cup. “That hesitation,” she said quietly.

The cup settled upright against the table. The drop slid back into the glass. Footsteps continued down the corridor, rhythm slightly off before smoothing out again.

Maelin stopped moving.

Edrin stood fast enough to jolt the bench. Wood complained. The ledger slid from his hands and scattered across the floor, pages fanning where they landed.

Ilyra stepped forward, then checked herself. Her bare foot shifted against stone. Her gaze stayed on Rachel.

Rachel drew her hand back and pressed it against her thigh. Heat lingered in her palm.

“I didn’t touch it,” Rachel said.

Maelin set the cup down with care. Her fingers stayed there a moment longer than necessary before she stepped away from the table.

“We saw,” she said.

Edrin crouched, gathering the ledger page by page. One corner caught under the bench. He tugged it free and stacked the papers against his knee.

Ilyra said Rachel’s name once. Quietly.

The sound carried across the table.

Rachel swallowed. Her tongue stuck briefly to the roof of her mouth. “It was going to fall.”

“Yes,” Ilyra said.

Rachel’s mouth opened. Closed. Her shoulders dropped a fraction.

Maelin drew a breath. Her hands came together, fingers threading and unthreading. “Are you all right?”

Rachel nodded once. The motion slowed and stopped halfway.

Edrin finished stacking the ledger and set it down farther from the table than before. He nudged the bench back with his foot.

The room shifted around Rachel.

Maelin angled her body away from the table. Edrin moved to the side, leaving open space in front of her. Ilyra stayed where she was, weight balanced, attention steady.

Rachel tracked each adjustment.

Her hands curled loosely at her sides. She rubbed her thumb against the side of her finger, feeling a faint tackiness where the table’s finish had warmed under her skin. “I didn’t want it to spill.”

Maelin inclined her head.

Edrin straightened. “We’re going to slow things down.”

Rachel focused on her breathing. Air moved in. Out. Her pulse steadied enough to count.

“What does that mean?” she asked.

Maelin answered as she took another step back. “It means you’ll have space.”

Distance opened without comment. The table no longer pressed at Rachel’s side.

Ilyra’s gaze softened briefly as Rachel shifted, then settled again.

Rachel rested her palm against the table’s edge. The wood angled beneath her hand. It stayed where it was.

Nothing else moved.

“I need to tell my boyfriend,” Rachel said. “He’s going to be looking for me.”

Maelin nodded. “We’ll work on that.”

Rachel watched her mouth as she spoke. The pause before the words. The breath afterward.

She didn’t press.

The room carried on around her—someone picking up a plate, the pot lid settling back into place, a chair leg scraping before being corrected. Careful movements. Ordinary ones.

Rachel stayed where she was, counting time by the small motions people made when they weren’t sure how to proceed.
