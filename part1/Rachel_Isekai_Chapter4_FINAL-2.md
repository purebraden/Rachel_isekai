# Chapter Four

Rachel couldn't stop replaying it.

Not the cup itself. The space just before it should have fallen. The slack moment where everything waited. She'd tried once already, right after it happened, but nothing had come. The magic—if that's what it was—had felt as distant as a half-remembered dream.

That had been hours ago.

Now morning light filtered through the windows, breakfast was cleared, and she was still thinking about it. The way time had paused. The way the cup had drifted down instead of falling.

Her fingers pressed together. Released. Pressed again.

Edrin had been watching her fidget for the past ten minutes. Finally, he spoke. "Do you want to try again?"

The question landed carefully, gently.

Rachel looked at him. "I tried yesterday. Nothing happened."

"I know," he said. "But you've had time to think about it now. Sometimes that helps."

Maelin set down the cloth she'd been using to wipe the table. "When it worked—when you stopped the cup—what did you feel?"

Rachel flexed her hand, remembering. "My palm. It was warm. Like... tingling, but not quite. More like a pulse." She shook her head. "I don't know how to describe it."

"That's all right," Maelin said. "Warm is good. That's something to focus on."

"Did you feel anything else?" Edrin asked, leaning forward. "In your chest? Your head?"

Rachel thought back. "My breath caught. High up, like—" She pressed a hand just below her throat. "Like something pulled tight there."

Edrin nodded, making a mental note. "That's the hesitation point. Where you're holding the boundary."

"I wasn't trying to hold anything," Rachel said. "I just didn't want the cup to break."

"That's the instinct," Maelin said gently. "The wanting. The rest followed."

Rachel stared at her hands. "So I need to want something badly enough?"

"Maybe," Edrin admitted. "Or you need to remember what that wanting felt like."

"That's fine," Maelin said, already scanning the table. "We'll keep it small this time. No pressure."

Ilyra didn’t say anything. She moved a cup closer to the edge, then stopped with it half an inch short and glanced at Rachel.

Rachel nodded once.

They cleared a space without announcing it. Plates slid aside. The pot was lifted and set farther back. Edrin steadied the table with his knee while Maelin adjusted the cup.

“Whenever you’re ready,” Maelin said.

Rachel stared at the cup.

She tried to remember the feeling. Not the image. The timing. The breath caught high in her chest. The way her hand had risen without instruction.

She lifted her hand again.

Nothing paused.

She waited, holding her breath, then let it out slowly and tried again. The room stayed ordinary. The cup stayed where it was.

Edrin shifted. “Try not to rush it.”

Rachel closed her eyes.

She pictured the gap. The held drop. The moment that didn't belong to motion. Her hand lifted higher this time, fingers spread, attention narrowing until the table edge pressed hard against her hip.

Something in the air changed.

A pressure built—not outside her, but through her, like her body had become a conduit for something that didn't belong. The warmth she'd felt before flared in her palm, spreading up her arm.

But it felt wrong.

When she'd stopped the cup, the sensation had been warm, yes, but also... light. Quick. Like touching something hot and pulling away before it burned. This was different. The heat kept building, spreading, growing heavier with each breath. It didn't flow through her—it pooled, thick and sluggish, like trying to push syrup through a narrow tube.

Her chest tightened. Not the clean catch of breath from before, but a constricting feeling, like invisible hands squeezing her ribcage.

Then the floor shifted beneath her feet.

Not much. Just enough to notice. Just enough to know it was wrong.

The room tilted.

At first it was subtle—a degree or two to the left, like standing on a boat in gentle waves. Rachel's weight redistributed automatically, body compensating before her mind caught up.

But it didn't stop.

The angle increased. Slowly. Inexorably. Like reality itself was sliding sideways.

Plates scraped against the table, moving on their own, defying their careful placement. The cup that had been sitting innocently now leaned, water climbing one side of the glass as if up had rotated ninety degrees and was still rotating.

Rachel's inner ear screamed wrongness. Her stomach twisted hard, vertigo slamming into her as her balance failed to find purchase. The floor was solid—she could feel it under her feet—but it insisted it was slanted, and her body believed it even as her eyes said everything was still level.

She grabbed for the table edge. Her hand swept through empty air where it should have been.

"Stop," Ilyra said, voice sharp.

But Rachel couldn't stop. Didn't know how. The sensation in her palm had become a fire, spreading up her arm and into her chest where that tight feeling had lodged like a fist. The magic—if that's what this was—wasn't flowing anymore. It was stuck, trapped inside her with nowhere to go, building pressure like water behind a dam.

And she was the dam, and the dam was breaking.

Edrin moved toward her, hand out, then jerked back. "Rachel, you need to—"

The tilt steepened.

Books slid from shelves she couldn't see. Something clattered to the floor in another room. The building itself seemed to groan, wood and stone protesting an angle they were never meant to hold.

Rachel's feet skidded. The stone floor that had been perfectly flat now felt like a slope, like she was standing on a hillside that kept getting steeper. She staggered sideways, arms windmilling, balance completely gone.

Nausea hit like a physical blow. Her vision grayed at the edges. Her stomach heaved, bile rising hot and acidic in her throat.

"Door," she managed, one hand clamped over her mouth. "Outside. Now."

Maelin was already turning. Ilyra had the door open before Rachel finished the sentence.

Rachel stumbled through it.

Earth rushed up under her shoes, uneven but honest. The world snapped back into place as soon as she cleared the threshold, the tilt vanishing so abruptly it left her swaying. One moment gravity was a suggestion her body couldn't follow; the next it slammed back into normalcy with jarring finality.

She bent over, hands braced on her knees, retching. Nothing came up but air and the sour taste of fear. Her stomach clenched and released, clenched again. Sweat beaded cold on her forehead.

The fire in her palm was gone. The pressure in her chest—gone. Like someone had pulled a plug and let it all drain away the instant she crossed out of the building.

Rachel stayed bent over, breathing hard, waiting for her body to believe it was safe.

Cool wind cut across her face, carrying scents she didn't recognize—something green and sharp, like pine but sweeter. Her pulse hammered in her temples. Her legs shook.

Slowly, carefully, Rachel straightened and looked up.

The sky wasn't the right color. 

A pale wash that leaned green near the horizon, thinning as it rose, light spreading through it without glare. Not blue. Not any shade her eyes wanted to correct into something familiar. Just... that. Green-tinged and vast and utterly other.

It should have looked alien. Wrong. Should have triggered some primal rejection in her brain—this is not your sky, not your world, not where you belong.

Instead, some part of her—some part she didn't want to examine too closely—recognized it.

Not the specific shade or the quality of light, but something deeper. The way it settled against her skin felt right in a way Earth's sky never had. The way the air moved through her lungs, carrying that strange sweet-sharp scent, felt like breathing properly for the first time after years of shallow breaths.

She'd spent twenty-six years feeling like she didn't quite fit anywhere. And now, standing under an alien sky on an alien world, having just nearly turned a room sideways with her mind, her body was saying: Yes. Here. This.

The wrongness of that rightness made her stomach twist all over again.

Rachel turned away from the sky, rejecting the thought, rejecting the feeling, rejecting all of it.

Trees ringed the clearing, their trunks familiar in shape—oak-like, sturdy—but carrying broad blue leaves that caught the light in flat planes like solar panels. The color was too saturated to be natural, too vibrant. One leaf tore loose as she watched, drifting down on a wind she couldn't feel, spinning once, twice, before settling near her shoe.

She didn't touch it.

The grass beneath her feet was grass, or close enough. Green, at least. That was something.

Movement caught her eye.

Something crossed the clearing at a distance, low to the ground, moving through patches of sunlight and shadow. Four legs. Fur the color of old copper. The shape of a deer at first glance—long neck, narrow head, careful steps—until it turned.

Rachel's breath caught.

Too many joints in the legs. An extra bend where there shouldn't be one, making the gait fluid but wrong, like watching a video played back at slightly the wrong speed. Each step placed the hoof-like feet a fraction out of sequence with what her brain expected.

It paused near the tree line and lifted its head, testing the air.

The eyes were set too far forward. Predator eyes, not prey. But the body said prey—graceful, delicate, built to run.

Her mind tried to reconcile the contradiction and failed.

The creature regarded her across the distance. Not with fear. Not with curiosity. With simple acknowledgment: You exist. I exist. This is the space between us.

Then it moved on, slipping between the trunks with impossible silence, and was gone.

Rachel stood in the clearing, breath slowing, eyes fixed on the place where it had disappeared. 

That creature belonged here. Moved through this world like it was made for it, contradictions and all. It didn't question the green sky or the blue leaves or the wrong angle of light. It just... existed. Fit.

The way Rachel had never fit anywhere in her entire life.

The way she'd just fit inside that building for one terrible moment, bending reality around her without meaning to.

Her hands had stopped shaking. The nausea had faded to a dull ache. The trapped-fire sensation was completely gone now, leaving only the memory of how wrong it had felt—and the knowledge that it had come from her. That she could do it again, accidentally, at any moment.

Behind her, the open doorway stayed quiet. No one had followed her out. Giving her space, maybe. Or afraid to see what else she might accidentally break.

She didn't blame them.

Rachel took one more breath of the too-sweet air, let the alien sky press against her skin one more moment, then turned back toward the door.

She couldn't stay out here forever. And despite everything—despite the danger, despite the fear, despite having just nearly torn a building apart with her mind—some part of her didn't want to.

The clearing would still be here tomorrow. The wrong sky. The impossible creatures.

But inside were people who'd seen her at her most dangerous and hadn't run.

That had to mean something.

Rachel walked back toward the doorway. Back toward whatever came next.
