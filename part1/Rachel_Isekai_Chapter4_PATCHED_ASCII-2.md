# Chapter Four

Rachel could not stop replaying it.

Not the glass itself. The space just before it should have fallen. The slack moment where everything waited. She ran the sequence again while standing at the table, then once more while Maelin shifted plates back into place. The room kept moving. The gap did not return.

Her fingers pressed together. Released. Pressed again.

Edrin spoke first. "Can you do it again?"

The question landed without weight.

Rachel looked at him. "I don't know how I did it the first time."

"That's fine," Maelin said. She was already scanning the table. "We'll keep it small."

Ilyra did not say anything. She moved a cup closer to the edge, then stopped with it half an inch short and glanced at Rachel.

Rachel nodded once.

They cleared a space without announcing it. Plates slid aside. The pot was lifted and set farther back. Edrin steadied the table with his knee while Maelin adjusted the cup.

"Whenever you're ready," Maelin said.

Rachel stared at the cup.

She tried to remember the feeling. Not the image. The timing. The breath caught high in her chest. The way her hand had risen without instruction.

She lifted her hand again.

Nothing paused.

She waited, holding her breath, then let it out slowly and tried again. The room stayed ordinary. The cup stayed where it was.

Edrin shifted. "Try not to rush it."

Rachel closed her eyes.

She pictured the gap. The held drop. The moment that did not belong to motion. Her hand lifted higher this time, fingers spread, attention narrowing until the table edge pressed hard against her hip.

The floor shifted.

Not much. Just enough.

The room tipped a few degrees to the left.

Plates slid against the table with a soft scrape. Water crept sideways in the cup, climbing the glass instead of settling. Rachel's stomach lurched as her balance went with it, her inner ear insisting she was falling when she was not.

She grabbed for the table and missed.

"Stop," Ilyra said.

Edrin moved at the same time, hand out, then pulling back short of contact. "Rachel--"

The tilt increased.

Rachel's feet skidded on stone that no longer felt level. Nausea surged hard and fast, blotting out everything else. She gagged, one hand clamped over her mouth.

"Door," she said. "Outside. Now."

Maelin was already turning. Ilyra had the door open before Rachel finished the sentence.

Rachel stumbled through it.

Earth rushed up under her shoes, uneven but honest. The world snapped back into place as soon as she cleared the threshold, the tilt vanishing so abruptly it left her swaying.

She bent over, hands braced on her knees, retching air and nothing else.

Cool wind cut across her face.

Rachel straightened and looked up.

The sky was not the right color. A pale wash that leaned green near the horizon, thinning as it rose, light spreading through it without glare.

She turned.

Trees ringed the clearing, their trunks familiar in shape but carrying broad blue leaves that caught the light in flat planes. One tore loose and drifted down, spinning once before settling near her shoe.

Movement caught her eye.

Something crossed the clearing at a distance, low to the ground. Four legs. Fur. The shape of a deer at first glance--long neck, narrow head--until it turned.

Too many joints in the legs. The bend was wrong. The gait did not match the body, each step placing the hoof-like feet a fraction out of sequence.

It paused near the tree line and lifted its head.

The eyes were set too far forward.

The animal watched her for a moment, then moved on, slipping between the trunks and out of sight without sound.

Rachel stood in the clearing, breath slowing, eyes fixed on the place where it had disappeared.

Behind her, the open doorway stayed quiet.
