# Chapter Five

Rachel stayed outside longer than she needed to.

She walked the edge of the clearing first, slow and uneven, boots sinking slightly into the dirt where the ground softened. Her hand brushed bark as she passed the nearest tree. The texture surprised her—fibrous, almost layered. One of the blue leaves hung low enough to touch. It bent under her fingers, thicker than it looked, veins pressed close beneath the surface.

She let go and stepped back, heart still beating too fast for standing still.

The sky didn’t change.

Neither did the trees.

Footsteps approached behind her, steady and unhurried.

Rachel didn’t turn.

Maelin stopped a few paces away. “Are you dizzy?”

“A little.”

“Do you want to sit?”

Rachel shook her head. “If I sit, I think I won’t get back up.”

“All right.” Maelin stayed where she was. “Are you nauseous?”

“Not anymore.”

“Good.” A pause. “If that changes, tell me.”

Rachel huffed out a breath. “You’re very calm about this.”

Maelin smiled faintly. “I’m trying not to add to what you’re already carrying.”

Rachel glanced at her then. “You don’t look scared.”

“I am,” Maelin said. “Just not of you.”

Rachel looked back at the trees. “I didn’t know it was going to do that.”

“I know.”

“You didn’t expect me either.”

“No.”

Silence stretched between them, filled by wind moving through the leaves overhead. The blue shifted as the branches swayed, light flattening across them in a way Rachel’s eyes kept trying to correct.

“We can talk out here if you want,” Maelin said. “Or we can go back inside. No more trying things. Not today.”

Rachel closed her eyes for a second. The tilt of the room came back to her, sharp and unwelcome.

“Inside,” she said. “But I want answers.”

Maelin nodded. “That’s fair.”

They walked back together. Rachel slowed at the threshold, one last look at the clearing, then crossed it.

Inside, the room had been rearranged.

Not dramatically. Just enough. Chairs pulled back. Objects spaced wider apart. The ledger sat closed near Edrin instead of spread across the table. Ilyra leaned against the wall, arms crossed, posture loose but alert.

Rachel noticed all of it before she noticed them watching her notice.

“Sit,” Maelin said gently. “Or don’t.”

Rachel sat.

The room felt quieter with everyone in it than it had before. Not silent. Just contained.

“I’m going to ask questions,” Rachel said. Her thumb worried at the seam of her sleeve as she spoke. “Probably out of order.”

Maelin nodded and pulled her own chair a little closer, not enough to crowd. “That’s fine.”

“Good,” Rachel said. “Because I don’t think I can do this neatly.”

Ilyra pushed off the wall and hooked one ankle behind the other, arms folding across her chest. “No one’s grading you.”

Rachel huffed out a breath and looked at the table. The surface still held the faint ring where the cup had been. “Where am I.”

Edrin leaned forward, forearms braced on his knees. The ledger rested beside him, closed now, his fingers tapping once against its cover before stilling. "This settlement sits at the edge of what we call the Near March—a region where worlds come close enough to brush. Not layered. Not stacked. More like pressure points. We're in the safe zone here, but the March itself is... volatile."

“That doesn’t mean anything to me,” Rachel said, without looking up.

“I know,” he said quickly. “I’m not trying to be evasive. I’m trying not to lie by making it sound simpler than it is.”

Rachel nodded once. “So it’s not my world.”

“No,” Maelin said. She reached for the pitcher as she spoke, then stopped, hands hovering for a moment before setting it back down. “It isn’t.”

Rachel leaned back, chair legs scraping softly against the floor. “You didn’t drug me.”

“No,” Maelin said, immediate and steady. “We wouldn’t. And we didn’t.”

Ilyra shifted her weight. “If we had, you’d still be out cold. Or yelling at us.”

Rachel barked a laugh and then pressed her lips together, surprised it had come out. “Okay. Good. Because that was really bothering me.”

Edrin picked up where Maelin left off. “The working we used was designed to cross boundaries, not to bring someone through physically, and certainly not from your side of the March. We were expecting—” He paused, fingers lifting slightly, then lowering again. “Something else.”

“But it got me.”

“Yes,” he said. “And we don’t know why.”

Rachel looked up then, really looked at him. “You really don’t.”

“No,” Edrin said. “If we did, we’d already be telling you.”

Maelin leaned forward, forearms resting on her thighs. “We’re not holding anything back.”

Rachel’s gaze dropped to the table again, to the careful distance between objects. “And what I did. With the glass. With the room.”

“We believe that originated with you,” Edrin said. “But not intentionally, and not in a way we understand yet.”

Ilyra crossed the room and stopped short of the table, palms braced against the edge without touching it. “You didn’t fake it. You didn’t plan it. And you didn’t handle it like someone who knew what they were doing.”

Rachel snorted. “That obvious.”

“Yeah,” Ilyra said. “In a good way.”

Rachel rubbed her hands together once, then flattened them against her thighs. “So what happens if I try again.”

Edrin inhaled, then exhaled slowly through his nose. “That’s where we slow down. Because the second attempt didn’t echo the first. It reacted differently.”

“Meaning it could get worse.”

“Yes,” he said.

“Or sideways,” Ilyra added.

Rachel closed her eyes briefly, then opened them again. “And you can’t send me back.”

“No,” Maelin said quietly.

“You can’t even talk to my world.”

Edrin shook his head. “We wouldn’t know how to aim a message across that distance.”

Rachel leaned back until the chair legs hit the floor again. “So I’m stuck.”

“For now,” Maelin said. “Not forever. Just… now.”

Rachel’s jaw tightened. She reached up and scrubbed at her face, then dropped her hand. “I don’t love that.”

“I wouldn’t expect you to,” Maelin said.

Silence stretched. Edrin shifted in his seat. Ilyra uncrossed her arms and crossed them again the other way.

"What do you need right now," Maelin asked finally, "to get through the next hour."

Rachel stared at the floor, following a crack in the stone until it disappeared under the table. What did she need? 

Back home, the answer would have been space. Distance. Time alone to process and compartmentalize and file everything away in the right mental boxes. To make herself small and manageable and fine.

Here, the answer felt different. Wrong. Dangerous.

She needed them to keep talking. Needed the weight of Maelin's attention and Edrin's earnest concern and even Ilyra's blunt observations. Needed to not be alone with what she was becoming.

When had she ever needed people like this?

"I need to not break anything," she said finally. "And I need to not feel like I'm going to."

Edrin nodded slowly. "That's reasonable."

"You also need sleep," Ilyra said.

Rachel blinked. "Do I."

"You're buzzing," Ilyra said. "Hard."

Maelin reached for the pitcher this time and poured, the water sloshing slightly before settling. She slid the glass across the table, stopping it well short of Rachel's hands.

Rachel waited a beat, then took it.

The glass stayed solid.

She drank, setting it down carefully when she was done.

Nothing tilted. Nothing pushed back.

Her shoulders lowered a fraction on their own.

"There's something else you should know," Edrin said quietly.

Rachel looked at him. His expression had gone serious, almost apologetic.

"The summoning," he continued. "The way it pulled you through. That creates a kind of... resonance. Between you and this world."

"What does that mean?" Rachel asked.

Edrin glanced at Maelin, who nodded for him to continue.

"It means the longer you're here, the more this world recognizes you," he said. "The magic you're developing—it's not just happening randomly. It's happening because you're becoming part of this place."

Rachel's stomach tightened. "And?"

"And that resonance goes both ways," Ilyra said bluntly. "The more it pulls you in, the harder it would be to send you back. Eventually..." She shrugged. "Eventually it might not be possible at all."

The words landed like stones in still water.

"How long?" Rachel asked.

"We don't know," Maelin admitted. "Could be weeks. Could be months. But every day you're here, the connection strengthens."

Rachel stared at the table. "So there's a timer on whether I can go home."

"Yes," Edrin said simply.

"Okay," Rachel said, though nothing felt okay. "Then we figure this out. Together. Quickly."

Maelin nodded.
Edrin let out a breath he'd been holding.
Ilyra tipped her head once, sharp and approving.

No one argued.
