## Chapter Five

Rachel paused at the threshold.

The doorway stood open before her, dark and cool compared to the alien brightness outside. Inside waited answers, probably. Caution. Maybe fear. People who'd just watched her nearly tear reality apart.

She could go back in. Should go back in.

Her feet didn't move.

One more breath of too-sweet air. One more moment under the wrong sky. Her pulse was still too fast, her hands still unsteady, but the trapped-fire sensation was completely gone. The building's interior felt... heavier somehow. Like walking back into pressure she hadn't noticed until she'd left it.

Rachel's hand rose to her chest, pressing where that warmth had been.

Nothing now. Just the steady thump of her heart.

She took a step toward the door.

Maelin appeared in the doorway, silhouetted against the dim interior. She didn't come out, just stood there, patient. Waiting.

"Are you all right?" Maelin asked quietly.

Rachel let out a breath she didn't know she'd been holding. "Are you asking if I'm dizzy or if I'm okay?"

"Both," Maelin said. "Either."

Rachel managed a weak smile. "Dizzy, a little. But not nauseous anymore."

"That's good." Maelin didn't move from the doorway. "Do you need more time out here?"

Did she? Rachel glanced back at the clearing. The blue-leaved trees swaying in wind she couldn't feel. The green-tinged sky that felt more right than it should. The spot where the impossible creature had stood and regarded her with its wrong-placed eyes.

This world was alien. Dangerous. She'd just proven that she was dangerous in it.

And some treacherous part of her didn't want to leave.

"No," Rachel said, forcing the word out. "I should come in."

Maelin's hand lifted, palm up. "If you need space—"

"I don't need space." Rachel stepped forward, close enough now to see Maelin's expression clearly. "I need answers. I need to understand what I just did and why it went so wrong and—" Her voice cracked slightly. "I need to know if I'm going to hurt someone."

Maelin's expression softened. "You won't. Not while we're careful."

"You don't know that."

"No," Maelin admitted. "But I believe it. And I'm willing to help you prove it."

The simple confidence in her voice steadied something in Rachel's chest.

"Inside," Rachel said again, but firmer this time. "I want answers."

Maelin nodded and stepped back, making room. "That's fair."

Rachel crossed the threshold. The air changed immediately—cooler, heavier, that subtle pressure settling back over her skin like a weight she'd briefly forgotten.

Inside, the room had been rearranged.

Not dramatically. Just enough. Chairs pulled back. Objects spaced wider apart. The ledger sat closed near Edrin instead of spread across the table. Ilyra leaned against the wall, arms crossed, posture loose but alert.

They'd cleared the space around where Rachel had stood.

Where she'd nearly torn reality apart.

Rachel stopped just inside the door, staring at that empty space. "You moved everything away from where I was."

"Yes," Maelin said simply.

"Because I'm dangerous."

"Because we don't understand what happened yet," Maelin corrected gently. "And until we do, we're being careful."

Rachel's hands curled into fists at her sides. "I could have killed you. All of you. The building was—I felt it groaning, like it was going to come apart."

"But it didn't," Edrin said.

"Because I ran outside!" Rachel's voice cracked. "Not because I stopped it. Not because I had any control. I just—fled. And what if next time I can't? What if it happens when I'm sleeping, or—"

"Rachel." Ilyra's voice cut through, not unkind. "Sit down before you fall down."

Rachel realized her legs were shaking. She moved to the nearest chair and collapsed into it more than sat.

The room stayed quiet. No one rushed to reassure her. No one told her it would be fine.

"I'm scared," Rachel said finally, voice small. "Of myself. Of what I can do."

"That's smart," Ilyra said.

Rachel's head snapped up. "That's not helpful."

"Wasn't trying to be helpful," Ilyra said. "Trying to be honest. You should be scared. We're scared too."

"Ilyra—" Maelin started.

"No, she's right." Rachel rubbed her face with both hands. "You should be scared. You should probably kick me out. Send me away from here before I—"

"We're not doing that," Maelin said firmly.

"Why not?" Rachel demanded. "I'm a danger to you. To everyone. I don't know what I'm doing and I can't control it and—"

Edrin leaned forward. "And you came back inside anyway."

Rachel stopped.

"You could have stayed outside," he continued. "Could have run. Put distance between us and whatever you think you might do. But you came back. You chose to face this with us instead of alone."

Rachel's throat tightened. "That doesn't make me less dangerous."

"No," Maelin agreed. She pulled her chair closer, slowly, deliberately. "But it means you want to learn. To understand. To control it. And that's what matters."

"You don't know that I can," Rachel whispered. "Learn to control it, I mean."

"We don't," Ilyra said bluntly. "But we're going to try anyway."

Rachel looked between them, searching for doubt, for fear, for any sign they were just being polite before they found a way to get rid of her.

She found determination instead. And something that looked almost like... solidarity.

"Why?" Rachel asked. "Why help me? You didn't ask for this. For me."

Edrin leaned forward, forearms on his knees. "Because you didn't ask for this either. And because—" He hesitated, then continued. "Because leaving you to figure it out alone would be cruel. And dangerous. For everyone."

"Practical and ethical," Ilyra added with a half-smile. "My favorite combination."

Despite everything, Rachel felt a laugh try to escape. It came out more like a sob.

Maelin reached for the pitcher and poured water, then slid the glass across the table. It stopped well short of Rachel's hands.

Rachel stared at it. "You're not handing it to me."

"Not yet." Maelin's fingers stayed loose around the cup. "When you're ready."

Rachel understood. They were giving her control. Letting her decide when to reach for it, when to trust herself not to accidentally... what? Shatter it? Freeze it mid-air?

She took a breath and reached for the glass.

Her hand didn't shake. The glass stayed solid. The water stayed water.

She drank it slowly, tasting the cold, the slight mineral quality. Normal. Ordinary.

When she set it down, nothing tilted. Nothing pushed back.

Her shoulders lowered a fraction.

"Okay." Her voice came out steadier than expected. "What do we do? How do we make sure I don't... do that again?"

"We go slow," Edrin said. "We watch for warning signs. The sensations you felt—the heat in your palm, the pressure in your chest—those are tells. You learn to recognize them before they build."

"And if I can't?"

"Then you get outside," Ilyra said practically. "Away from enclosed spaces. Away from things that can break."

"That's your safety plan?" Rachel asked. "Run outside?"

"For now," Maelin said. "Until we understand more."

Rachel rubbed her temples. "This is insane. I'm insane. This whole situation is—"

"Hard," Maelin finished. "And frightening. And deeply unfair. But not insane."

"What about my life?" Rachel asked. The words came out sharper than she intended. "My job. My boyfriend. Everyone who—" Her voice broke. "How long has it even been? For them?"

The three exchanged glances.

"We don't know," Edrin admitted. "Time doesn't align between worlds. It could be hours. It could be longer."

Rachel's stomach dropped. "So Evan might think I'm already dead."

No one contradicted her.

Maelin looked down at her hands. "We can't send messages between worlds. I'm sorry. That's not within our abilities."

Rachel pressed her palms flat against the table, focusing on the solid wood, the grain beneath her fingers. "So I'm just... stuck here. With powers I don't understand and can't control, in a world that isn't mine, while everyone I know thinks I'm—" She couldn't finish the sentence.

"You said you can't send messages," Rachel said slowly. "But you could send me back. Eventually. When you figure out how. Right?"

The silence stretched too long.

"Right?" Rachel repeated, voice rising.

Edrin's expression turned pained. "It's... complicated."

"Uncomplicate it."

He exchanged a glance with Maelin, who nodded.

Edrin chose his words with visible precision. "The summoning created a connection between you and this world. A resonance. That's why you can do what you do—the magic isn't something you're casting, it's something you're... conducting. From here."

Rachel's chest tightened. "Okay. And?"

"And the longer you're here, the stronger that connection becomes," he continued. "The magic isn't just happening randomly—it's happening because you're becoming part of this place. The world is recognizing you as... belonging."

The word hit like a punch.

"But I don't belong here," Rachel said. "I belong back home."

No one responded.

"The resonance goes both ways," Ilyra said finally, her usual bluntness softened. "The more this world pulls you in, claims you, the harder it would be to send you back."

"How much harder?" Rachel demanded.

"We don't know," Maelin admitted. "We've never tried to reverse a summon before. But the magic you're developing—it ties you here. Every day you stay, every time you use it, even accidentally... the threads get stronger."

Rachel's hands were shaking again. She pressed them flat against the table. "So there's a time limit. On getting home."

Edrin's jaw tightened. "We think so. But we don't know how long. Weeks, maybe. Possibly months."

"Or less," Ilyra added. "Depends on how fast you're integrating."

Rachel laughed, the sound hollow and broken. "So I have to choose. Learn to control this power—which might take weeks or months—or try to get home before I'm stuck here forever. And I don't know which is possible or how long I have before the choice is made for me."

"We'll find a way," Maelin said. "To do both. To give you both options."

"You don't know that," Rachel whispered.

"No," Maelin admitted. "But we're going to try anyway."

The honesty of it—the refusal to offer false comfort—steadied something in Rachel's chest.

She looked at each of them in turn. Maelin, determined. Edrin, guilty and earnest. Ilyra, blunt but present.

Three strangers who'd accidentally kidnapped her and were now promising to help fix the unfixable.

"Okay," Rachel said finally. "Then we work fast. Together. And we figure this out before I run out of time."

Edrin nodded.

Maelin's expression softened with something like relief.

Ilyra uncrossed her arms. "First step: you need rest. Can't control magic if you're ready to fall over."

Rachel wanted to argue. Wanted to demand they start immediately, that every wasted moment was a moment closer to being trapped.

But Ilyra was right. Her hands were trembling with exhaustion. Her thoughts felt fuzzy at the edges.

"Fine," she said. "But tomorrow we start. No delays."

"Tomorrow," Maelin agreed.

Rachel stood, legs unsteady but holding. The room didn't tilt. Nothing shattered.

Small victories.

Rachel looked at each of them in turn. They'd stayed. Through the disaster, through her losing control, through the very real possibility she could have killed them. They'd stayed.

"We don't run," Ilyra said with a slight smile, reading Rachel's expression. "Not our style."

Rachel found herself almost smiling back.
