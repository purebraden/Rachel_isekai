# Chapter Six

Rachel woke to movement.

Not footsteps. Paper. The soft rasp of a page being turned, then turned back again. She lay still and listened to it repeat, the sound threading through her half-sleep until it pulled her the rest of the way awake.

Edrin was already up.

He’d taken over the long table near the windows. Books were stacked in uneven piles, some open, some marked with scraps of paper folded into the spines. A shallow bowl held bits of chalk and a metal compass she didn’t recognize. He was reading from one volume while flipping back through another, eyes moving as if the text continued across bindings.

Rachel stayed where she was, watching him work.

He noticed her attention and looked over, blinking as if he’d forgotten she was there. “Sorry. Did I wake you?”

“No,” she said. “I think this place did.”

He smiled at that, distracted. “The March never really sleeps.”

She waited until he turned back to the table before swinging her legs over the side of the bed. The stone floor felt cool and solid under her feet as she stood and crossed the room, stopping a few steps from the table.

“What are you doing?”

“Looking for anything that resembles what you did,” he said. He tapped a margin with his finger, then frowned and slid the book aside. “So far, it’s mostly things that don’t fit.”

“That’s reassuring.”

“It should be,” he said. “It means you didn’t break anything old.”

“Just something new.”

“Possibly.”

Ilyra was in the doorway again, arms folded, watching them with the same expression she’d worn the night before. “You’re already thinking about trying again.”

Edrin didn’t deny it. “Thinking isn’t the same as doing.”

“Looks close from here.”

Maelin came in behind her with a tray, setting it down on the edge of the table. Bread, fruit, something warm in a small cup. She didn’t interrupt the conversation, just made the food available and took a seat nearby.

Rachel tore off a piece of bread. "You keep talking about the March."

"The Near March," Edrin said absently. "It's the unstable region to the east of here—where boundaries break down. There are others farther out, but this one's closest to the settled routes. We maintain this outpost at its edge to monitor it."

“That doesn’t mean anything to me.”

He nodded. “It’s a place where things brush up against each other. Worlds, I mean. Not gently.”

“That’s comforting.”

“It isn’t meant to be.”

Maelin watched Rachel chew, then said, "We didn't expect to pull a person through. That part is… unusual."

"How unusual," Rachel asked.

Edrin hesitated. "We've never done it."

Ilyra snorted. "He means no one we know has."

Rachel swallowed. "So you're new at this."

The conversation felt comfortable. Easy in a way that made no sense. She'd known these people for what—two days? Three? And yet sitting here with them, eating bread and discussing accidental summoning, felt more natural than dinner with Evan ever had.

That thought landed cold and sharp.

Evan, who'd known her for two years. Who brought her food when she was stressed and never pushed when she went quiet. Who loved her.

And these three strangers—her kidnappers, technically—already felt more like home than he ever had.

What did that say about her?

"We've studied it," Edrin said, pulling her back. "Theory, mostly. Observations. Secondhand accounts."

Rachel looked at the books again, grateful for the distraction from her own thoughts. "Those don't look secondhand."

"They are," he said. "Someone else's notes. Someone else's failures."

Maelin leaned back in her chair. “My mother told me a story once. About a village near the old crossings. She said a woman there could stop things without touching them. Just for a breath. Just long enough to step out of the way.”

Rachel froze. “What happened to her?”

Maelin’s mouth tightened slightly. “No one knows. The stories don’t agree.”

“That’s not helpful,” Rachel said.

“No,” Maelin agreed. “But it’s the only thing I’ve ever heard that sounds even close.”

Edrin stopped flipping pages. “That’s not in the records.”

“My mother didn’t keep records,” Maelin said.

Silence settled over the table. Rachel became acutely aware of her hands, resting flat against her thighs. She lifted one slightly, then let it fall again.

“You want me to try,” she said.

Edrin nodded. “Only if you’re willing.”

“I am,” Rachel said. “But I don’t want to guess.”

“That’s the problem,” Ilyra said. “We’re all guessing.”

Maelin leaned forward. “We can stop. There’s no requirement that you do anything today.”

Rachel shook her head. “If this is happening anyway, I’d rather it happen on purpose.”

They cleared the table more out of habit than necessity. Rachel stood where she had before, feet planted carefully, as if the floor might remember her last mistake.

“Tell us what you’re thinking,” Maelin said.

“The pause,” Rachel said. “Not the fall. The space right before.”

She lifted her hand slowly.

For a moment, nothing happened.

Then the air thickened. Not visibly. Just enough that Rachel felt it resist her fingers, like moving through water. The table creaked, a low sound that raised the hairs on her arms.

Ilyra straightened. “That’s enough.”

Rachel dropped her hand. The pressure vanished.

Edrin had reached for his pen, then stopped himself and set it down. “That wasn’t the same as before.”

“No,” Rachel said. “It felt heavier.”

The room shifted, barely. Just enough to make the cup rattle against the table.

Ilyra swore quietly. “We need to stop.”

Maelin didn’t argue. She was already standing.

Edrin ran a hand through his hair. “This isn’t behaving the way it should.”

Rachel looked at him. “Should.”

He exhaled. “We’re out of our depth.”

That hung there.

"We don't have to call him yet," Maelin said. "We could wait. Observe."

Rachel's head snapped up. "No."

They all looked at her.

"No," she repeated, steadier this time. "You just told me you're out of your depth. That this is 'not behaving the way it should.' You want to wait and observe while I—what? Accidentally tear reality apart?" She stood, hands flat on the table. "Who's got answers? Who can actually help?"

Edrin's shoulders slumped slightly. "Arathen. My mentor. He taught me most of what I know."

"Then call him," Rachel said.

"And he taught you to stop when things go sideways," Ilyra added quietly.

Edrin didn't argue with that.

Maelin looked at Rachel, something like respect crossing her face. "Calling him changes things. It makes this… official. Other people will know about you."

Rachel considered that. The books. The stories. The way the room had tilted, just a little, like a warning. The timer ticking down on whether she could ever go home.

"Then we call him," she said firmly. "Because right now I've got magic I don't understand, a world that's trying to claim me, and a countdown on getting back to my life. I need someone who knows what they're doing. And apparently, that's not you three."

The bluntness hung in the air.

"No," Edrin admitted. "It's not."

Edrin nodded slowly and reached for the book.
