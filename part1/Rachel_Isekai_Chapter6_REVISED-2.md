# Chapter Six

Rachel woke to movement.

Not footsteps. Paper. The soft rasp of a page being turned, then turned back again. She lay still and listened to it repeat, the sound threading through her half-sleep until it pulled her the rest of the way awake.

Edrin was already up.

He'd taken over the long table near the windows. Books were stacked in uneven piles, some open, some marked with scraps of paper folded into the spines. A shallow bowl held bits of chalk and a metal compass she didn't recognize. He was reading from one volume while flipping back through another, eyes moving as if the text continued across bindings.

Rachel stayed where she was, watching him work.

He noticed her attention and looked over, blinking as if he'd forgotten she was there. "Sorry. Did I wake you?"

"No," she said. "I think this place did."

He smiled at that, distracted. "The March never really sleeps."

She waited until he turned back to the table before swinging her legs over the side of the bed. The stone floor felt cool and solid under her feet as she stood and crossed the room, stopping a few steps from the table.

"What are you doing?"

"Looking for anything that resembles what you did," he said. He tapped a margin with his finger, then frowned and slid the book aside. "So far, it's mostly things that don't fit."

"That's reassuring."

"It should be," he said. "It means you didn't break anything old."

"Just something new."

"Possibly."

Ilyra was in the doorway again, arms folded, watching them with the same expression she'd worn the night before. "You're already thinking about trying again."

Edrin didn't deny it. "Thinking isn't the same as doing."

"Looks close from here."

Maelin came in behind her with a tray, setting it down on the edge of the table. Bread, fruit, something warm in a small cup. She didn't interrupt the conversation, just made the food available and took a seat nearby.

Rachel tore off a piece of bread. "You keep talking about the March."

"The Near March," Edrin said absently. "It's the unstable region to the east of here—where boundaries break down. There are others farther out, but this one's closest to the settled routes. We maintain this outpost at its edge to monitor it."

"That doesn't mean anything to me."

He nodded. "It's a place where things brush up against each other. Worlds, I mean. Not gently."

"That's comforting."

"It isn't meant to be."

Maelin watched Rachel chew, then said, "We didn't expect to pull a person through. That part is… unusual."

"How unusual," Rachel asked.

Edrin hesitated. "We've never done it."

Ilyra snorted. "He means no one we know has."

Rachel swallowed. "So you're new at this."

The conversation felt comfortable. Easy in a way that made no sense. She'd known these people for what—two days? Three? And yet sitting here with them, eating bread and discussing accidental summoning, felt more natural than dinner with Evan ever had.

That thought landed cold and sharp.

Evan, who'd known her for two years. Who brought her food when she was stressed and never pushed when she went quiet. Who loved her.

And these three strangers—her kidnappers, technically—already felt more like home than he ever had.

What did that say about her?

"We've studied it," Edrin said, pulling her back. "Theory, mostly. Observations. Secondhand accounts."

Rachel looked at the books again, grateful for the distraction from her own thoughts. "Those don't look secondhand."

"They are," he said. "Someone else's notes. Someone else's failures."

Maelin leaned back in her chair. "My mother told me a story once. About a village near the old crossings. She said a woman there could stop things without touching them. Just for a breath. Just long enough to step out of the way."

Rachel froze. "What happened to her?"

Maelin's mouth tightened slightly. "No one knows. The stories don't agree."

"That's not helpful," Rachel said.

"No," Maelin agreed. "But it's the only thing I've ever heard that sounds even close."

Edrin stopped flipping pages. "That's not in the records."

"My mother didn't keep records," Maelin said.

Silence settled over the table. Rachel became acutely aware of her hands, resting flat against her thighs. She lifted one slightly, then let it fall again.

"You want me to try," she said.

Edrin nodded. "Only if you're willing."

"I am," Rachel said. "But I don't want to guess."

"That's the problem," Ilyra said. "We're all guessing."

Maelin leaned forward. "We can stop. There's no requirement that you do anything today."

Rachel shook her head. "If this is happening anyway, I'd rather it happen on purpose."

They cleared the table more out of habit than necessity. Rachel stood where she had before, feet planted carefully, as if the floor might remember her last mistake.

"Tell us what you're thinking," Maelin said.

"The pause," Rachel said. "Not the fall. The space right before."

She lifted her hand slowly.

For a moment, nothing happened.

Then the air thickened. Not visibly. Just enough that Rachel felt it resist her fingers, like moving through water. The table creaked, a low sound that raised the hairs on her arms.

Ilyra straightened. "That's enough."

Rachel dropped her hand. The pressure vanished.

Edrin had reached for his pen, then stopped himself and set it down. "That wasn't the same as before."

"No," Rachel said. "It felt heavier."

The room shifted, barely. Just enough to make the cup rattle against the table.

Ilyra swore quietly. "We need to stop."

Maelin didn't argue. She was already standing.

Edrin ran a hand through his hair. "This isn't behaving the way it should."

Rachel looked at him. "Should."

He exhaled. "We're out of our depth."

That hung there.

"We don't have to call him yet," Maelin said. "We could wait. Observe."

Rachel's head snapped up. "No."

They all looked at her.

"No," she repeated, steadier this time. "You just told me you're out of your depth. That this is 'not behaving the way it should.' You want to wait and observe while I—what? Accidentally tear reality apart?" She stood, hands flat on the table. "Who's got answers? Who can actually help?"

Edrin's shoulders slumped slightly. "Arathen. My mentor. He taught me most of what I know."

"Then call him," Rachel said.

"And he taught you to stop when things go sideways," Ilyra added quietly.

Edrin didn't argue with that.

Maelin looked at Rachel, something like respect crossing her face. "Calling him changes things. It makes this… official. Other people will know about you."

Rachel considered that. The books. The stories. The way the room had tilted, just a little, like a warning. The timer ticking down on whether she could ever go home.

"Then we call him," she said firmly. "Because right now I've got magic I don't understand, a world that's trying to claim me, and a countdown on getting back to my life. I need someone who knows what they're doing. And apparently, that's not you three."

The bluntness hung in the air.

"No," Edrin admitted. "It's not."

Edrin stood, pushed his chair back with care, and crossed to the shelf along the interior wall. His fingers moved across spines slowly, not searching so much as confirming they were still there. When he stopped, it was on a thin volume wedged between two heavier books. He eased it free like the shelf might resist if he rushed.

The cover was plain brown cloth, worn pale at the corners. One edge had been repaired with thread that didn't match.

Maelin straightened before Rachel fully registered why.

From the doorway, Ilyra let out a short breath through her nose. Not a laugh. Not quite.

Rachel watched all three of them react, then looked back at the book. It didn't look like anything. If it had been sitting on her coffee table back home, she would have picked it up, flipped it open, and put it back down without a thought.

"What?" she said finally. "Is that the call-him book?"

Edrin didn't correct her. He carried it to the table and set it down carefully, fingers lingering on the cover as if he were reminding himself it was real. "It's a paired volume."

"So," Rachel said, leaning forward, then stopping herself halfway. "Letters appear? Like magic mail?"

"You write here," he said, opening it and smoothing the first pages with his palm. "He receives it there."

"How long does that take?"

Edrin didn't answer right away. He adjusted the cloth marker, frowned at the page, then said, "It depends."

"On what?"

"Distance. Conditions." He lifted his hand and Rachel saw faint impressions in the paper, old writing pressed deep into the fibers. "On him."

Rachel leaned back. "Does it always work?"

"When it matters," Maelin said.

Rachel turned to her. "That wasn't the question."

Maelin met her eyes. "It was my answer."

Rachel let that sit. "So this matters?"

Maelin reached for the pitcher instead of answering, poured water, and set a glass closer to Rachel's side of the table. The sound of it touching wood landed heavier than a yes or no.

Edrin turned to a page marked with a narrow strip of cloth. The paper there was cleaner, less bruised by use. He took a small tin from his pocket and opened it. The smell reached Rachel first—metallic, sharp, like crushed coins and leaves.

"That's ink?" Rachel asked.

"It is."

He picked up the pen, then stopped, the nib hovering. Not frozen. Thinking.

"Before I write," he said, "I want to be clear."

Rachel folded her arms. "Clear is good."

"I'm going to write what we know. And what we don't." His eyes flicked to her, then away. "And I'm not going to guess about your world."

Rachel nodded. "Okay."

Maelin said quietly, "And you can stop us."

Ilyra pushed off the doorway and came closer, boots quiet on stone. "You can also tell him yourself, if you want?"

Rachel opened her mouth, then closed it. "I don't know what I'm allowed to say."

"That's not a trick question," Ilyra said. "That's the problem."

Edrin exhaled and dipped the pen. Ink stretched thin before breaking. He waited again.

Maelin said his name.

He looked up.

She nodded toward Rachel, then toward the chair nearest the table.

Edrin slid it out with his foot. Rachel took it without ceremony. From there the table felt farther away. Safer. Her knee bounced once before she caught it.

"What are you writing?" she asked.

"An opening. A description. A request."

"Start with 'we messed up,'" Ilyra said.

"That's implied."

"Make it less implied."

"Not like that," Maelin said, already smiling.

Rachel let out a breath she hadn't realized she'd been holding. "Can I see it first?"

"Yes." Immediate.

He grabbed a scrap of paper instead and wrote quickly. When he slid it across, Rachel read it, then read it again.

**Arathen—We attempted a cross-boundary summons and received an unanticipated subject. We need your guidance.**

"That makes me sound like a loose animal," Rachel said.

Ilyra snorted.

Edrin grimaced. "It's an opening line."

"It makes me a thing."

He flipped the paper without arguing and rewrote.

**Arathen—We attempted a cross-boundary summons and brought through a person. Her name is Rachel.**

Rachel read it more slowly this time. "Better. But add something else."

Edrin looked up, pen hovering.

"Tell him I'm cooperating," Rachel said. "Tell him I want to understand what's happening to me. And—" She hesitated, then pushed forward. "Tell him there might be a timer on sending me back, so if he has answers, we need them soon."

Edrin met her eyes, then nodded and added the lines.

Maelin said, "Thank you," and meant more than the words.

Edrin wrote it into the book. The ink sank unevenly, dark at the edges. He paused often, not to think, but to wait.

"You're telling him about the hesitation?" Ilyra asked.

"Yes."

"And the tilt?"

"Yes."

"And the resonance effect?" Rachel added.

Edrin nodded. "I have to. He needs to know everything."

"And the fact that—"

"Ilyra," Maelin said.

Ilyra stopped, hands lifted. "Okay."

Rachel swallowed. "What fact?"

Edrin didn't answer. His pen hovered.

"That's a face conversation," Maelin said. "Not an ink one."

Rachel didn't like it, but she understood. Some things couldn't be written down. "Fine. But he needs to know I'm not passive in this. I'm trying to work with you."

"I'll make that clear," Edrin promised.

When Edrin finished, he didn't close the book right away. He let the page sit, then closed it gently.

"What now?" Rachel asked.

"Now we wait."

"How long?"

Edrin glanced at Maelin.

"We'll know."

Rachel pressed her lips together. Trust a clock she couldn't see.

Ilyra moved first. "We're not staring at it."

Maelin stood, set cups out, tore bread, poured tea. Someone sat. Someone stood again. Steam curled and thinned.

Rachel picked up fruit, set it down. "Okay," she said. "Normal conversation. On purpose."

"Yes," Maelin said.

Rachel looked at Edrin. "What were you like before all this?"

"Before?" He frowned. "I studied binding theory."

"That still sounds like summoning."

"It isn't," he said, then sighed. "It's the structure underneath. The part where answers exist before language."

"You always talk like that?" Rachel asked.

"Only when he's nervous," Ilyra said.

Edrin shot her a look. "I don't—"

"You do," Maelin said. "Less now."

Rachel smiled. "I worked in logistics. Scheduling. Operations. I fixed things before anyone noticed they were broken."

Edrin nodded. "You managed systems."

Rachel pointed at him. "That. You just did my job."

"Then we'd get along," he said.

"I would've made you label everything."

"I already do."

Later—after tea had cooled and been reheated—Maelin asked about Evan.

Rachel hesitated. "He's a physical therapist."

"That sounds useful," Maelin said.

"It is," Rachel said. "He fixes people. Bodies, I mean. He's really good at it."

Ilyra leaned against the wall. "How's he when he's angry?"

Rachel blinked. "Quiet."

"Quiet how?"

She thought about it. "He apologizes. Even when he shouldn't. He starts asking questions like he's trying to solve the argument instead of being in it."

Ilyra nodded slowly. "Fixer."

"Yes," Rachel said. "He'll take the blame just to keep things moving."

Maelin's voice was gentle. "That can be kind."

"It is," Rachel said. "It's also exhausting."

Later still—after Evan drifted away and came back sideways—Rachel asked Ilyra how she knew so much about injuries.

Ilyra shrugged. "My aunt ran a clinic near one of the river routes. People came through half-broken and lied about how bad it was."

"You learned healing there?" Rachel asked.

"Because no one else would," Ilyra said. "You patch first. You ask later. Sometimes never."

Maelin watched her carefully.

Ilyra went on, voice rougher now. "People don't tell the truth about pain. Bodies do."

Rachel found herself nodding, understanding settling deep. Back home, conversations like this—real ones, past the surface—had felt like work. Performance. She'd measured every word, calibrated every response, constantly aware of how she appeared.

Here, she'd just asked. And Ilyra had just answered. No performance required.

The ease of it should have comforted her.

Instead, it felt like proof of something she didn't want to acknowledge: that she'd been performing her entire life, and only now, in this impossible place with these strangers, had she stopped.

The book stayed on the table.

No one touched it.

Then Edrin lifted his head.

Maelin froze.

Ilyra went still.

"What?" Rachel asked.

Edrin crossed the room and opened the book.

The writing appeared slowly.

**Received.**

Then:

**Do not attempt replication again.**

Rachel leaned forward before she meant to.

More lines followed.

**Is she stabilized after the hesitation?**  
**Describe the environmental response in exact terms.**  
**Where are you holding her?**

"Holding?" Rachel said.

"He means location," Edrin said automatically.

The last line took longer.

**I am coming. Do nothing until I arrive.**

No one spoke.

Rachel stood. The bench scraped as she moved.

"I'm going outside," she said.

She didn't wait for permission.

As she moved toward the door, that persistent thought returned: Every hour here makes it harder to leave. The resonance was pulling her deeper into this world with each breath, each step, each moment of belonging. The timer was ticking, and she could feel it in her bones now—not as urgency, but as inevitability.
