# Chapter Six

Rachel woke to movement.

Not footsteps. Paper. The soft rasp of a page being turned, then turned back again. She lay still and listened to it repeat, the sound threading through her half-sleep until it pulled her the rest of the way awake.

Edrin was already up.

He’d taken over the long table near the windows. Books were stacked in uneven piles, some open, some marked with scraps of paper folded into the spines. A shallow bowl held bits of chalk and a metal compass she didn’t recognize. He was reading from one volume while flipping back through another, eyes moving as if the text continued across bindings.

Rachel stayed where she was, watching him work.

He noticed her attention and looked over, blinking as if he’d forgotten she was there. “Sorry. Did I wake you?”

“No,” she said. “I think this place did.”

He smiled at that, distracted. “The March never really sleeps.”

She waited until he turned back to the table before swinging her legs over the side of the bed. The stone floor felt cool and solid under her feet as she stood and crossed the room, stopping a few steps from the table.

“What are you doing?”

“Looking for anything that resembles what you did,” he said. He tapped a margin with his finger, then frowned and slid the book aside. “So far, it’s mostly things that don’t fit.”

“That’s reassuring.”

“It should be,” he said. “It means you didn’t break anything old.”

“Just something new.”

“Possibly.”

Ilyra was in the doorway again, arms folded, watching them with the same expression she’d worn the night before. “You’re already thinking about trying again.”

Edrin didn’t deny it. “Thinking isn’t the same as doing.”

“Looks close from here.”

Maelin came in behind her with a tray, setting it down on the edge of the table. Bread, fruit, something warm in a small cup. She didn’t interrupt the conversation, just made the food available and took a seat nearby.

Rachel tore off a piece of bread. “You keep calling this place the March.”

“The Near March,” Edrin said absently. “There are others farther out, but this one’s closest to the settled routes.”

“That doesn’t mean anything to me.”

He nodded. “It’s a place where things brush up against each other. Worlds, I mean. Not gently.”

“That’s comforting.”

“It isn’t meant to be.”

Maelin watched Rachel chew, then said, “We didn’t expect to pull a person through. That part is… unusual.”

“How unusual,” Rachel asked.

Edrin hesitated. “We’ve never done it.”

Ilyra snorted. “He means no one we know has.”

Rachel swallowed. “So you’re new at this.”

“We’ve studied it,” Edrin said. “Theory, mostly. Observations. Secondhand accounts.”

Rachel looked at the books again. “Those don’t look secondhand.”

“They are,” he said. “Someone else’s notes. Someone else’s failures.”

Maelin leaned back in her chair. “My mother told me a story once. About a village near the old crossings. She said a woman there could stop things without touching them. Just for a breath. Just long enough to step out of the way.”

Rachel froze. “What happened to her?”

Maelin’s mouth tightened slightly. “No one knows. The stories don’t agree.”

“That’s not helpful,” Rachel said.

“No,” Maelin agreed. “But it’s the only thing I’ve ever heard that sounds even close.”

Edrin stopped flipping pages. “That’s not in the records.”

“My mother didn’t keep records,” Maelin said.

Silence settled over the table. Rachel became acutely aware of her hands, resting flat against her thighs. She lifted one slightly, then let it fall again.

“You want me to try,” she said.

Edrin nodded. “Only if you’re willing.”

“I am,” Rachel said. “But I don’t want to guess.”

“That’s the problem,” Ilyra said. “We’re all guessing.”

Maelin leaned forward. “We can stop. There’s no requirement that you do anything today.”

Rachel shook her head. “If this is happening anyway, I’d rather it happen on purpose.”

They cleared the table more out of habit than necessity. Rachel stood where she had before, feet planted carefully, as if the floor might remember her last mistake.

“Tell us what you’re thinking,” Maelin said.

“The pause,” Rachel said. “Not the fall. The space right before.”

She lifted her hand slowly.

For a moment, nothing happened.

Then the air thickened. Not visibly. Just enough that Rachel felt it resist her fingers, like moving through water. The table creaked, a low sound that raised the hairs on her arms.

Ilyra straightened. “That’s enough.”

Rachel dropped her hand. The pressure vanished.

Edrin had reached for his pen, then stopped himself and set it down. “That wasn’t the same as before.”

“No,” Rachel said. “It felt heavier.”

The room shifted, barely. Just enough to make the cup rattle against the table.

Ilyra swore quietly. “We need to stop.”

Maelin didn’t argue. She was already standing.

Edrin ran a hand through his hair. “This isn’t behaving the way it should.”

Rachel looked at him. “Should.”

He exhaled. “We’re out of our depth.”

That hung there.

“We don’t have to call him yet,” Maelin said. “We could wait. Observe.”

“And do what,” Ilyra asked. “Hope it doesn’t get worse.”

Edrin’s shoulders slumped slightly. “Arathen would know what questions to ask.”

Rachel glanced between them. “Who’s Arathen.”

“My mentor,” Edrin said. “He taught me most of what I know.”

“And he taught you to stop when things go sideways,” Ilyra added.

Edrin didn’t argue with that.

Maelin looked at Rachel. “Calling him changes things. It makes this… official.”

Rachel considered that. The books. The stories. The way the room had tilted, just a little, like a warning.

“Then maybe it already is,” she said.

Edrin nodded slowly.

No one moved for a moment after that.

Outside, light shifted across the windows, blue leaves catching it and holding it longer than they should.
