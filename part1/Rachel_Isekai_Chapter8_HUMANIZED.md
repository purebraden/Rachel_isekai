## Chapter Eight

Rachel woke already tired.

Not the earned kind—the kind that came after long days or late nights—but something that settled in her bones like sediment. She'd slept, as far as she could tell. The room had stayed dark and quiet. Her body had gone still. But rest hadn't followed.

She lay there longer than necessary, staring at the ceiling and tracing the pattern where stone met wood. A hum lived under the floorboards, faint but persistent, like a pulse that didn't quite belong to her.

Except it did now. More than yesterday. More than the day before.

The building was awake, and she could feel it. Not like sensing movement in another room, but like feeling her own heartbeat. The distinction should have bothered her more than it did.

Every day she spent here, the resonance grew stronger. She could feel herself sinking roots into this place, or it sinking hooks into her—she wasn't sure which. Maybe both.

The timer was ticking. How many days had it been now? Five? Six? Each one made the connection deeper, the path back narrower. Soon—maybe already—it would be too late to return even if they found a way.

And the terrifying part was how little that thought bothered her.

She didn't know how she knew that. The knowledge arrived without explanation, settling into certainty before her mind could question it.

When she finally stood, nothing changed. No pressure gathered in response. No awareness tracked her movement. That absence should have steadied her. Instead it felt like the space before a verdict, when the silence meant someone had already decided.

Rachel moved down the hall without choosing a destination and found herself at the outer door, hand resting against the latch. The air pressed differently here—thicker, weighted, as if the walls leaned inward when she came too close to leaving.

She opened the door.

Outside, the sky stretched pale and wrong, that faint green wash she couldn't correct no matter how long she stared. Light filtered through leaves too broad and too blue, their veins pressing close to the surface like something preserved under glass. A sound drifted from the tree line—almost birdsong, almost familiar, before it fractured into something that didn't map to memory.

Rachel stepped into the clearing.

The pressure eased at once, loosening around her shoulders and ribs like a grip she hadn't known was there. Air moved differently here. Freer. Less observed.

She walked without purpose or plan, letting her feet choose direction. Her breathing slowed. Her pulse steadied. The wrongness didn't correct itself, but it stopped asking her to notice.

She stayed longer than she meant to—long enough that counting time became irrelevant, long enough that her attention softened at the edges.

Then she felt it.

Not movement. Not sound. Just awareness, distinct and undeniable, that something behind her had noticed her absence.

Rachel stopped.

She turned back toward the building. The structure stood unchanged, stone and wood settled exactly where they'd been. But the air near the threshold looked different now—denser somehow, like heat gathering without warmth. She took a single step back toward it.

The sensation eased in response.

Her stomach tightened.

"You felt it too."

Rachel turned. Maelin stood several paces away, hands loose at her sides. Close enough to reach if needed. Far enough to let Rachel choose whether to close the distance.

Rachel swallowed. "The building. It knows I left."

Maelin's gaze tracked the space between Rachel and the door, measuring something Rachel couldn't name. "Knows," she repeated quietly. "Not notices?"

Rachel took another step toward the threshold. The pressure softened again, settling like recognition. "It's counting," she said. "Keeping track."

Maelin exhaled slowly, the sound carrying weight. "Then we don't test that alone."

"I know." Rachel meant it. She stepped back again, feeling the air reshape itself around her, familiar now in a way that made her skin prickle.

The door opened.

Arathen stood in the frame as if he'd been there all along, attention fixed somewhere past them both.

"Well," he said. His voice stayed level, clinical. "That clarifies something."

Rachel's hands curled. "You were watching."

"Yes."

She waited for an apology. None came.

"Of course," she said.

His gaze shifted to her, brief and assessing. "If it helps, I didn't cause the response."

"It doesn't," Rachel said.

He nodded once, as if that answer satisfied him more than reassurance would have.

They returned inside together. The air closed around Rachel as soon as she crossed the threshold—not painful, but deliberate, as if invisible hands had reached out to confirm her return. Arathen shut the door. The latch settled with a quiet click that felt too final.

Rachel stopped in the center of the room, hands flexing at her sides. The wrongness pressed closer here. Not threatening. Just present, like a question waiting to be asked.

"I need to do something," she said. Her voice came out steadier than she felt. "With my hands. Something normal."

Arathen watched her for a moment, gaze moving across her face in that way he had—measuring, but not unkind. Then he nodded once. "The kitchen is yours."

"Alone," Rachel added, then caught herself. "If that's—I just need to think while I work."

He considered that. A small crease appeared between his brows. "Stay clear of the outer wall. Nothing heavy. And if something feels off, say so immediately."

Rachel's jaw loosened slightly. The impulse to argue faded. He wasn't trying to control her. He was trying to keep her safe. The distinction mattered more than she'd expected.

"All right," she said. "Thank you."

His expression softened just slightly. "Of course."

Ilyra shifted in the doorway, watching but giving her space. Edrin glanced up from his book, concern crossing his face before he caught himself and looked away.

Rachel moved to the kitchen.

The counter sat lower than her apartment had been, the angle wrong enough to notice. She reached for a pan and felt the weight settle unexpectedly in her palm—heavier than it looked, the balance off-center. The knife she lifted wanted to roll in her grip. She adjusted without thinking, fingers finding the right pressure through habit alone.

Heat built slowly beneath the pan. Too slowly. She stood waiting, palm resting against the stone counter, feeling that persistent hum travel up through her arm.

"You move like someone who learned efficiency under pressure," Arathen observed from somewhere behind her. Not judging. Just noticing.

Rachel didn't turn. "I learned to cook when I was too tired to care what it tasted like. As long as it was food and it was fast."

A pause. "That's a particular kind of tired," Maelin said softly.

Rachel cracked an egg—or something like one—into a bowl and frowned at the color. Pale yellow leaning green. Wrong, but not alarmingly so. She stirred it anyway.

Edrin hovered at the edge of her peripheral vision, attention caught between his forgotten book and her hands. "That pan doesn't heat evenly," he blurted out, then winced. "The left side takes longer. I can find you a better one—"

"Edrin," Arathen said gently.

Edrin flushed. "Right. Sorry. I'll just—" He retreated to the table, looking miserable.

Rachel glanced over her shoulder at him. "It's okay. I'm used to uneven pans. My old stove was worse."

Edrin's expression eased slightly. He nodded, grateful.

Maelin sat with a cup cradled in both hands, steam rising between her fingers. She watched Rachel for a moment, then said quietly, "Your shoulders."

Rachel paused mid-stir. Realized they'd climbed toward her ears again. She forced them down, felt the muscles protest. "I do that when I'm concentrating. My boyfriend—" She stopped, the present tense suddenly wrong. "Evan used to point it out."

Maelin's mouth curved with sympathy. "He sounds observant."

"He is." Rachel stirred slower after that, letting the rhythm settle into something steady. "He'd hate this. All of it. The not knowing."

"You're worried about him," Maelin said.

Rachel opened her mouth to agree, then stopped. Was she? Constantly?

She tried to remember the last time she'd actively thought about Evan—not just mentioned him in conversation, but actually pictured him, worried about what he was going through. Hours ago? Yesterday?

The realization hit cold: she'd gone an entire day without thinking about him. An entire day of learning magic and reading impossible maps and eating meals with people who'd kidnapped her, and Evan had been—what? Background noise? An obligation she'd remember eventually?

"Yes," she said, but the word tasted like a lie. "Constantly."

The food came together without her full attention—automatic motions her hands remembered even when her mind wandered. She slid portions onto plates and passed one toward Maelin without looking.

Maelin accepted it, silent for a moment. "You do that without thinking."

Rachel glanced at her. "Do what?"

"Take care of people," Maelin said. "Make sure everyone has what they need before they know to ask for it."

Rachel's hands stilled. The observation sat heavier than it should have. "I worked in operations," she said. "You notice things. It's just habit."

Arathen's attention shifted, sharpened with understanding. "Operations," he repeated thoughtfully.

"Logistics. Scheduling." Rachel plated another portion and handed it to Edrin, who accepted it with a quiet thank you. "I kept systems running. Fixed problems before anyone noticed they existed."

"That explains a great deal," Arathen said, and something in his voice made it sound almost like respect.

Rachel turned to look at him. "Explains what?"

He accepted the plate she offered him. "Why you read the map so clearly. Why you sense boundaries. You've spent years learning to see where things might break before they do."

The words landed softer than she'd expected, recognition rather than judgment.

They ate together after that—not rushed, but not quite relaxed either. Rachel remained standing, one hip braced against the counter, but it felt less like guarding and more like she simply didn't know where else to be. Edrin ate with focus, clearly hungry. Ilyra leaned against the far wall, and after a few bites looked up and said, "This is good. Thank you."

The simple acknowledgment loosened something in Rachel's chest.

Maelin moved between them with water, refilling cups, and when she passed Rachel she touched her shoulder briefly. Just once. A small gesture that said you're one of us now.

Rachel found herself almost smiling.

"If I go outside again," Rachel said, breaking the silence, "what happens?"

Maelin and Ilyra both looked toward Arathen.

He set his mug down with care. "That depends."

"On?"

"On whether the boundary keeps responding." His tone stayed even, clinical. "And whether the response escalates."

Rachel's stomach tightened. She turned toward the window, drawn by instinct or avoidance—she couldn't tell which. Her palm found the sill, cool stone under warm skin. Beyond the glass, the sky held its wrongness without apology. Light moved across the clearing in patterns that didn't belong to any sun she recognized.

"You're very calm about all of this," she said.

"I've been afraid before," Arathen said from behind her. "Panic doesn't improve outcomes."

Rachel closed her eyes briefly. Opened them. The view hadn't changed. "That's not reassuring."

"No," he agreed. "It isn't."

Silence stretched, filled only by the building's persistent hum. Rachel stayed at the window, listening to it pulse beneath her palm, feeling the space around her contract and release like breathing.

The hum had bothered her at first. Now it felt like a heartbeat she'd been missing her entire life.

That thought should have scared her. Should have sent her running for the door, demanding they find a way to send her back.

Instead, she just stood there, palm pressed to stone, and accepted it.

"I'll cooperate," she said quietly. "With whatever you need me to do."

The words came easy. Too easy. Like she'd already decided to stay long before her mind had caught up with the choice.

"For now," Arathen said.

She glanced back at him. Found him watching her with that same measured attention, neither kind nor unkind. Just observing.

"For now," she echoed.

The building hummed beneath her palm. Rachel closed her eyes and let it.
