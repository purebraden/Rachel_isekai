# Chapter Eight

Rachel was still outside when she heard the door.

Not the sound itself. This place had doors that sighed and settled and did their best to be quiet. It was the way the air behind her changed instead, like someone had stepped into the space carrying a different temperature with them.

She did not turn right away.

She stood under the wrong sky and let her breathing even out, because her body kept trying to sprint ahead of her brain, and her brain kept trying to sprint ahead of her life. Because the green-leaning light made her feel faintly sick if she stared at it too long.

Footsteps came closer over the dirt. Unhurried. Not cautious in the way Maelin had been cautious, like she was trying not to startle a wounded animal. These steps belonged to someone who assumed the ground would hold.

"Rachel?"

It was not Maelin.

Rachel turned.

Four people stood at the edge of the clearing instead of three.

Edrin was there, shoulders tight, hands folded like he no longer knew what to do with them. Maelin stood a half-step behind him, steady. Ilyra was off to the side, posture loose, eyes sharp, watching everything that was not the person in front of her.

And between them, slightly forward, like he had wandered into the right spot by accident, was a man Rachel had not seen before.

Older than the rest. Not old-old. Old enough that the lines at the corners of his eyes looked like they belonged there, earned doing something he liked. His hair was dark with silver threaded through it, pulled back without care and still somehow tidy. His coat was worn the way a useful thing gets worn, not the way an expensive thing gets damaged.

He looked at Rachel like she was a puzzle he wanted to solve, and like the puzzle might bite him if he did it wrong.

"Hi," he said, as if greeting her outside under a wrong-colored sky was a normal thing to do. "I'm Arathen."

Rachel waited for someone else to say something.

No one did.

She glanced at Edrin.

Edrin nodded once, the kind of nod people used when they were relieved and ashamed at the same time.

Rachel looked back at Arathen. "You came fast."

Arathen made a small face. "Fast is relative. You should see how slowly the March likes to cooperate when you're in a hurry."

Ilyra's mouth twitched.

Arathen noticed it and looked pleased with himself, like he had just scored a point in a game only he was playing. Then his eyes returned to Rachel, and the playfulness shifted aside without disappearing, making room for focus.

"Are you all right?" he asked.

Rachel's hands curled, then uncurled. "I don't know. I'm not hurt."

"That's a good start." He walked a few steps closer, stopping far enough away that he was not crowding her. He did not look at the sky until he was beside her, and when he did, he looked at it like he had seen this shade before and did not like what it implied.

"Pretty," he said lightly.

"It's wrong," Rachel said.

Arathen nodded. "Yes."

He turned back toward the others. "Inside, please. Let's not do heavy conversations in the open unless we have to."

Ilyra moved first. Maelin followed. Edrin hesitated, eyes flicking to Rachel, then to Arathen.

Arathen caught the hesitation and sighed. "Edrin. You did the right thing calling me."

Edrin's shoulders dropped a fraction. "We might have waited too long."

"Or too short," Arathen said. "Depends on what happens next."

They went back inside.

The room felt different with Arathen in it. Not rearranged. Claimed.

Arathen set his bag near the table. He did not touch the book.

"All right," he said, rubbing his hands once. "Tell me what happened. In your words."

Rachel sat. Maelin sat close. Ilyra leaned against the wall. Edrin hovered, then settled.

Rachel talked. About the summoning. The fear. The glass. The pause. The pressure.

"When you stopped the glass," Arathen said gently, "what were you thinking?"

"Don't spill," Rachel said. "Don't break."

"A prevention instinct," Arathen said. "Interesting."

"You're measuring me," Rachel said.

"I am," Arathen said calmly. "Not you. What you're carrying."

Rachel felt safer.

Rachel felt watched.

Arathen laid out rules. No testing alone. No new summoning. Familiar spaces only. Rest.

Rachel asked about home.

Arathen deferred.

Later, when Rachel asked what she was, he said, "You're Rachel."

Boxes, he said, were dangerous.

When the conversation slowed, Rachel asked to go outside again.

Arathen allowed it. With Maelin.

Outside, the sky was still wrong.

Rachel stood under it, breathing, the light pressing softly against her eyes the way it had before. Maelin stayed close without touching, close enough that Rachel could feel the heat of another person without having to acknowledge it.

Behind them, the door clicked as it settled back into place.

Rachel tipped her head up and watched the thin, green-leaning light slide across the leaves, the color refusing to correct itself no matter how long she stared.

She stayed there longer than she meant to.

When she finally looked away, it was not because the sky had changed.
