## Chapter Nine

Rachel woke with the sense that something had shifted while she slept.

Not movement. Not pain. Just a subtle rebalancing, like a shelf settling after weight had been taken off it. She stayed still for a moment, listening to her own breath move in the room, to the faint vibration under the floorboards that she was starting to recognize as the building’s default state.

When she stood, nothing reacted.

That was becoming its own kind of information.

She moved down the hall without trying to be quiet, but without making noise either. The air felt slightly denser near the walls, thinner toward the center, a difference she hadn’t noticed yesterday and couldn’t stop noticing now. By the time she reached the outer door, her palm was already warm against the latch.

The pressure gathered there. Not pain. Proximity. Like the space itself was leaning in.

She opened the door anyway.

Outside, the sky was still wrong.

The light leaned green, shallow in a way that made her eyes work harder than they wanted to. Leaves overhead shifted slowly, too broad, their veins catching brightness at angles that didn’t quite make sense. Something farther off called out—almost familiar, wrong at the edges.

Rachel stepped into the clearing and felt the pressure loosen immediately.

Not gone. Spread thinner. Like air moving into a larger room.

She walked a few paces farther, boots scuffing dirt, letting her shoulders drop as the relief held. Her breathing slowed without instruction. Whatever was pressing against her inside the building didn’t follow as closely out here.

“That’s… useful,” she murmured.

She stayed there longer than she meant to, watching the light slide across the leaves, feeling the difference hold.

Then the tug arrived.

Soft. Persistent. Not pulling her back so much as registering her absence.

Rachel stopped moving.

She turned slowly toward the building. Nothing visible had changed, but the air near the wall looked thicker, like heat haze without warmth. She took a cautious step back toward it and felt the tug ease in response.

“Okay,” she said under her breath. “So you notice.”

“You feel it too?”

Rachel turned. Maelin stood a short distance behind her, not close enough to intrude, close enough to be present. Her hands were loose at her sides, posture steady, eyes tracking Rachel rather than the space.

“Yeah,” Rachel said. She took another half-step toward the door, watching the shimmer thin. “I think the building wants me closer.”

Maelin didn’t move immediately. She watched the space where Rachel had been standing, then the space where she was now. “Closer like holding,” she said carefully. “Or closer like anchoring?”

Rachel considered it while shifting her weight again, testing. “Anchoring,” she said. “It’s not grabbing. It’s… counting.”

Maelin inhaled, slow. “Then we shouldn’t test it alone.”

“I know,” Rachel said. She took one more step back. The pressure settled into its earlier shape, contained, familiar now.

Behind them, the door opened.

Arathen stood in the doorway, already awake, coat unbuttoned, eyes alert in a way that suggested he’d been alert for a while.

“Well,” he said mildly, looking past them at the clearing. “That answers a question.”

Rachel turned on him. “You were watching.”

“Yes,” he said. “And before you ask—no, I didn’t cause it.”

“That’s comforting,” she said flatly.

He smiled just enough. “Adequate is my target.”

They crossed the threshold together. As Rachel stepped inside, the air tightened again, subtle but unmistakable, like lines being drawn around her. Arathen closed the door behind them without comment.

“I want to make breakfast,” Rachel said abruptly.

Arathen paused, then nodded. “Go ahead.”

“By myself.”

“Mostly,” he said. “Stay away from the outer wall. Don’t move anything heavy.”

She stared at him. “That’s most of cooking.”

“Constraints,” he said cheerfully. “Excellent for creativity.”

From the doorway, Ilyra snorted. “He means it.”

“I know,” Rachel muttered, already moving.

The kitchen felt familiar enough to be irritating. Counter height slightly off. The pan heavier than it looked. The knife balance wrong in her hand, wanting to roll instead of settle. She adjusted automatically, shifting grip, compensating without thinking.

The heat took longer to rise than she expected. She waited it out, fingers resting on the counter, feeling the faint hum under the stone.

“You cook like someone who learned under pressure,” Arathen said, watching her hands while pretending to look at his mug.

“I learned because ordering out was expensive and I hate wasting food,” Rachel said, cracking something into a bowl and frowning at the color before shrugging and continuing.

“Still pressure,” he said.

Edrin hovered near the counter, book forgotten at his side, eyes flicking between Rachel’s hands and the pan. “The heat distribution on that pan is uneven,” he blurted.

Arathen didn’t look at him. “Is she on fire?”

“No.”

“Then let her cook.”

Edrin flushed and retreated, knocking his elbow lightly against the table as he did.

Maelin watched quietly, hands wrapped around a cup. “Your shoulders,” she said.

Rachel paused mid-stir, then deliberately let them drop. The pan hissed softly as she adjusted the heat. “Didn’t notice.”

“You rarely do,” Maelin said.

Rachel stirred again, slower this time.

“So,” she said, eyes on the pan, “what did you do before you were… this?”

Arathen leaned back in his chair, one boot hooking around a rung. “This?”

She tipped her head toward him. “Walking into unstable situations and reorganizing people.”

He laughed, low and genuine. “I studied thresholds. Places that couldn’t decide what they were.”

“That sounds miserable.”

“It was,” he said easily. “I stayed too long. Learned not to.”

“Debatable,” Ilyra said, shifting her weight against the wall.

Rachel slid food onto plates, the motion automatic, then pushed one toward Maelin without looking. Maelin blinked, then accepted it.

“You do that automatically,” Maelin said.

“Do what?”

“Feed people,” Ilyra said. “Fix rooms.”

Rachel paused, spoon hovering. “I work in logistics.”

Arathen’s attention sharpened. “Of course you do.”

“That’s not—”

“It is,” he said. “You watch systems. You intervene before they fail.”

Edrin nodded eagerly, then stopped himself. “Exactly—”

“Careful,” Ilyra said. “You’re explaining again.”

Edrin shut his mouth.

They ate in pieces. Standing. Sitting. Standing again. Someone reheated something. Someone forgot salt and fixed it. The room stayed busy, ordinary motion threading between sentences.

“So what happens if I go outside again?” Rachel asked, leaning back against the counter, feeling the pressure hum faintly behind her eyes.

Maelin and Ilyra both glanced at Arathen.

“That depends,” he said.

“On what?”

“On how much the environment continues to respond,” he said. “And how quickly.”

Rachel watched steam curl up from a cup and fade. “You’re calm about that.”

“I’ve seen worse,” he said. “And better. This is… interesting.”

“That’s not reassuring.”

“I know.”

She studied him, then said quietly, “I’m not trying to run.”

“I believe you,” Arathen said. “That’s not the concern.”

“What is?”

“How much of the world notices when you move,” he said.

Silence settled, not heavy, just present, filled by the clink of a cup being set down, the scrape of a chair.

Later, Rachel drifted toward the window. No one stopped her. She rested her palm against the sill instead of the glass and watched the wrong sky beyond it.

“I’ll cooperate,” she said.

“For now,” Arathen replied from behind her.

“For now,” she echoed.

Outside, the light shifted slightly, just enough to register.

No one commented.

Rachel stayed where she was, feeling the shape of the room continue around her—people moving, air holding, the day organizing itself without asking.
