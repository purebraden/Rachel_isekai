## Chapter Nine

Rachel woke up already tired.

Not the kind of tired that comes from bad sleep — she’d slept fine, as far as she could tell — but the kind that settles in when your body decides it’s done being surprised and your brain hasn’t caught up yet. She lay there for a while, staring at the ceiling, counting the shallow hum under the floorboards because it gave her something to do with her attention.

The building was awake. It always was.

She didn’t know how she knew that. She just did.

When she finally got up, nothing happened. No pressure, no response, no sense of being watched more closely than usual. That should have made her feel better. It didn’t. It felt like the pause before someone asked a question they already knew the answer to.

Rachel drifted down the hall and stopped in front of the outer door without quite deciding to. Her hand rested on the latch longer than necessary. The air felt different here — thicker, like the building leaned in when she got too close to its edges.

She opened the door anyway.

Outside, the sky was still wrong, which was rude of it.

The light had that same faint green cast that made her eyes want to squint and fail at the same time. Leaves overhead shifted slowly, too large and too veined, and something farther away made a sound that nearly mapped to a bird and then didn’t. She stepped out into the clearing and felt the pressure ease immediately, like taking off shoes she hadn’t realized were too tight.

“Oh,” she said quietly. “That’s better.”

She walked a little farther, not fast, not slow, just letting herself move. Her shoulders dropped on their own. Her breathing slowed. The world didn’t fix itself, but it stopped crowding her.

She stayed there longer than she meant to. Long enough to stop cataloging everything and just exist in it.

Then she felt it.

Not a shove. Not a pull. Just the distinct sense that something behind her had noticed she was gone.

Rachel stopped.

She turned back toward the building. Nothing obvious had changed, but the air near the wall looked thicker somehow, like heat haze without the heat. She took a careful step back toward it and felt the sensation ease in response.

That did not make her feel better.

“You felt it too, didn’t you?”

Rachel turned. Maelin stood a short distance behind her, hands loose at her sides, not close enough to crowd, not far enough to pretend she wasn’t paying attention.

“Yeah,” Rachel said. “I think the building misses me.”

Maelin considered that, eyes tracking the space Rachel had just crossed. “Misses,” she repeated. “Not wants?”

Rachel thought about it. Took another small step toward the door. The pressure softened. “Misses,” she said. “Like it’s counting.”

Maelin exhaled slowly. “Then we shouldn’t play with that alone.”

“I know,” Rachel said, and meant it. She stepped back again, feeling the air settle into its earlier shape, familiar now in a way she didn’t love.

Behind them, the door opened.

Arathen stood there like he’d been there the whole time and had simply decided now was when he existed.

“Well,” he said mildly, looking past them into the clearing. “That answers something.”

Rachel turned on him. “You were watching.”

“Yes.”

“Of course you were.”

He smiled a little, like he appreciated her tone. “And before you ask — no, I didn’t cause it.”

“That’s generous of you,” she said.

“Adequate,” he replied.

They went back inside together. The air tightened around Rachel again as soon as she crossed the threshold, not painfully, just decisively, like a line had been redrawn. Arathen closed the door without comment.

“I want to make breakfast,” Rachel said suddenly, because if she didn’t say it now she might not say it at all.

Arathen studied her for a moment, then nodded. “Go ahead.”

“By myself.”

“Mostly,” he said. “Stay away from the outer wall. Don’t lift anything heavy.”

She stared at him. “You’re joking.”

“No.”

Ilyra, leaning in the doorway, snorted. “He never jokes about safety.”

“I gathered,” Rachel muttered, already moving.

The kitchen felt almost right, which was somehow worse than being completely alien. The counter was a little too low. The pan heavier than expected. The knife balance off, like it wanted to roll in her grip instead of settle. She adjusted automatically, the way she always did, compensating without thinking.

The heat took longer than she expected. She stood there waiting for it, fingers resting on the counter, feeling the faint hum under the stone.

“You cook like someone who learned under pressure,” Arathen said, watching her hands while pretending to look at his mug.

“I cook like someone who was tired and broke,” Rachel said, cracking something into a bowl and frowning at the color before shrugging and continuing.

“Same thing,” he said.

Edrin hovered nearby, book forgotten, eyes flicking between the pan and Rachel’s hands. “The heat distribution on that pan is uneven,” he blurted, then froze.

Arathen didn’t look at him. “Is she on fire?”

“No.”

“Then let her cook.”

Edrin flushed and retreated, bumping the table on the way.

Maelin watched quietly, hands wrapped around a cup. “Your shoulders,” she said.

Rachel paused, then deliberately let them drop. “I keep forgetting to notice that.”

“You usually do,” Maelin said.

Rachel stirred again, slower.

“So,” she said, mostly to the pan, “what did you do before you were… this?”

Arathen leaned back in his chair, one boot hooked around a rung. “This?”

She gestured vaguely. “Walking into problems and rearranging people.”

He laughed, low and real. “I studied thresholds. Places that couldn’t decide what they were.”

“That sounds awful.”

“It was,” he said easily. “I stayed too long.”

“Still do,” Ilyra said.

He tipped his mug at her.

Rachel slid food onto plates and pushed one toward Maelin without looking. Maelin blinked, then accepted it.

“You do that automatically,” Maelin said.

“Do what?”

“Feed people,” Ilyra said. “Fix rooms.”

Rachel paused, spoon hovering. “I work in logistics.”

Arathen’s attention sharpened. “Of course you do.”

“That’s not—”

“It is,” he said. “You watch systems until they stop pretending they’re fine.”

That landed harder than she expected.

They ate in fragments. Standing. Sitting. Standing again. Someone reheated something. Someone forgot salt and fixed it. The room stayed busy in small, ordinary ways that made the tension easier to ignore.

“So what happens if I go outside again?” Rachel asked eventually.

Maelin and Ilyra both looked at Arathen.

“That depends,” he said.

“On what?”

“On how much the world keeps answering,” he said.

Rachel leaned back against the counter, watching steam curl up from a cup and disappear. “You’re very calm about this.”

“I’ve seen worse,” he said. “And better.”

“That doesn’t help.”

“I know.”

Later, Rachel drifted toward the window. No one stopped her. She rested her palm against the sill instead of the glass and watched the wrong sky beyond it.

“I’ll cooperate,” she said quietly.

“For now,” Arathen said from somewhere behind her.

“For now,” she echoed.

Outside, the light shifted just enough to notice.

Rachel stayed where she was, listening to the building hum, letting the day sit unfinished around her.
