## Chapter Sixteen

The town arrived gradually—not with walls or gates, but with evidence of habitation seeping into the landscape like water finding its level. First came the cleared spaces where trees had been persuaded to grow elsewhere. Then stumps worn smooth by years of use as sitting places, resting places, places to set down what you carried. A path that had been walked often enough to become permanent.

Rachel noticed the transition. Noticed when the forest became managed, when wildness gave way to intention.

"Merridan's Cross," Edrin said, adjusting his pack. "Small trading post. We can resupply here."

Rachel's stomach tightened without clear reason. People. Strangers. The first time since the summoning that she'd need to exist around anyone who didn't already know what she was.

What she might be.

Maelin fell into step beside her, close enough that their shoulders nearly touched. "You'll be fine."

"I wasn't worried," Rachel said automatically, then caught herself. "That's a lie. I'm worried."

"Good," Maelin said. "Means you're paying attention."

The town materialized properly as they rounded the last bend—a collection of structures that seemed to have negotiated their placement with the forest rather than imposing themselves upon it. Wood and stone, practical and worn, arranged around a central square where people moved with the unhurried purpose of daily routine.

But the wood was wrong. Rachel noticed it immediately—the grain ran in spirals instead of straight lines, and the color shifted from gray to pale green depending on the angle of light. The stone wasn't quite stone either, or not any stone she recognized. Too smooth. Too uniform. Like it had been grown rather than quarried.

The sky above the square held that same faint green wash she'd never quite adjusted to, making the afternoon light feel perpetually on the edge of storm without ever delivering. Rachel counted maybe thirty buildings. Smaller than she'd expected. Larger than she'd hoped.

Ilyra moved ahead without discussion, her posture shifting into something more deliberate. Scout mode, Rachel had started calling it in her head. Edrin stayed close to Arathen, their conversation dropping to murmurs Rachel couldn't parse from this distance.

"First time's always strange," Maelin said quietly. "Being around people who don't know your story."

Rachel glanced at her. "How many times have you done this?"

"Enough to know the feeling doesn't go away." Maelin's mouth curved slightly. "You just get better at pretending it does."

They entered the square, and Rachel felt the shift immediately. Eyes found them—not hostile, just assessing. New people meant questions. Meant disruption to routine, however minor. 

A woman carrying baskets slowed her pace to watch them pass. The baskets were woven from something that looked like wicker but gleamed faintly, catching light like metal. Two men near a cart stopped their conversation mid-sentence. The cart's wheels were carved from a single piece of that wrong-grained wood, wearing smooth but not splintering.

Smells hit Rachel in waves—bread baking, but with an undertone that was almost citrus. Smoke from cook fires that smelled like pine and something sweeter, almost like vanilla. And underneath it all, that persistent herbal scent she'd started associating with this world, sharp and green and alive.

A child ran past chasing something that looked like a cat if cats had six legs and ears that swiveled independently. The creature chirped—actually chirped, like a bird—before disappearing between buildings.

Rachel kept her hands loose at her sides and tried to look like someone who belonged anywhere.

It didn't work.

She could feel it in the way attention slid over the others and caught on her. Edrin looked like a scholar. Maelin like a traveler. Ilyra like someone you didn't want to cross. Arathen like someone important trying not to be.

Rachel looked like someone who didn't fit her own skin.

"Ignore it," Maelin murmured.

"They're staring."

"They're curious. It's different."

"Doesn't feel different," Rachel said.

Arathen led them to a building marked with a hanging sign Rachel couldn't read—symbols that meant nothing to her but that the others recognized immediately as a general store. The door stood open, propped with a stone worn smooth on one side.

Inside, the air smelled like dust and dried herbs and something metallic Rachel couldn't identify—not iron or copper, but something that sat at the edge of those familiar scents without quite matching either.

Shelves lined the walls, packed with goods arranged in an order that made sense to someone but not to her. Jars held things that might have been grains or might have been something else entirely—one variety had a faint iridescent sheen, another seemed to shift colors as Rachel's angle of view changed. Fabric bolts in colors that didn't quite match Earth's palette—a blue that leaned too purple, a red that verged on orange but not quite. Rope coiled in bundles, but the fibers looked almost crystalline in places, catching the light coming through windows made of something clearer than glass should be.

A woman stood behind a counter near the back, her hands moving through the routine of inventory without looking up. She wore her hair in a braid that incorporated small beads—wooden, Rachel thought at first, until one caught the light and shimmered like abalone shell.

"Arathen," she said, voice carrying the weight of recognition.

"Merra," he replied, and Rachel heard warmth there. History. "It's been too long."

The woman looked up then, and her expression shifted through several emotions in quick succession—surprise, pleasure, something more complicated—before settling on professional welcome.

"Two seasons at least." Merra's eyes moved past Arathen to the rest of them, cataloging, assessing. They stopped on Rachel. Stayed there a beat too long. "You're traveling with a larger group than usual."

"Circumstances changed," Arathen said, easy and unrevealing.

Merra's attention lingered on Rachel for another moment before she seemed to physically pull it away. "What do you need?"

Edrin moved forward with a list he'd been maintaining since they'd left the outpost. His voice fell into the rhythm of negotiation—quantities, qualities, prices that meant something in a currency Rachel didn't understand. Maelin drifted toward the herb section, attention caught by something she recognized.

Rachel stood near the door and tried to be unobtrusive.

It didn't work.

She could feel Merra's awareness like a physical thing, kept carefully at the edge of her vision. Not looking directly. Not asking questions. But aware. Hyperaware.

Ilyra materialized beside Rachel, voice low. "She's nervous."

"Of me?"

"Of something." Ilyra's eyes tracked the shopkeeper with professional interest. "Could be you. Could be that we showed up at all. Hard to say."

Rachel watched Merra measure something into a cloth bag, movements precise and slightly too quick. "I'm making her uncomfortable."

"You're new," Ilyra said. "New makes everyone uncomfortable."

But that wasn't it. Rachel could tell. She'd spent twenty-six years reading rooms, calibrating her presence to make others comfortable, shrinking herself into acceptable shapes. She knew the difference between wariness of strangers and wariness of something else.

Something wrong.

Maelin called her over, gesturing to a display of travel supplies. "These are good," she said, holding up a pair of gloves. "Better than what you have."

Rachel accepted them, grateful for the distraction. The leather was soft, well-made, with reinforced palms. "How much?"

"Let Arathen handle the money," Maelin said. "We'll settle accounts later."

Rachel turned the gloves over in her hands, trying to feel normal. Trying to be normal. A person buying gloves in a shop. An ordinary transaction.

She moved toward the counter to add them to their collection of supplies.

Merra looked up as Rachel approached. Their eyes met.

The woman went still.

Not frozen. Not afraid exactly. But something in her expression shifted, retreating behind professional courtesy like a door closing softly but definitively.

Rachel set the gloves on the counter. "These too, please."

"Of course." Merra's hand reached for them.

Rachel reached at the same time.

Their fingers didn't touch—Rachel pulled back instinctively—but Merra flinched anyway. A small movement, quickly controlled, but unmistakable.

The shopkeeper took the gloves and added them to the growing pile, her movements brisk and final. "That's everything?"

"Yes," Arathen said, producing coins from a pouch Rachel hadn't noticed before. "Thank you, Merra."

"Safe travels," Merra said, and she meant it as dismissal.

They left.

Outside, the afternoon had progressed into something heavier, light thickening toward evening. The square had emptied somewhat, though Rachel still felt eyes tracking their movement.

"Well," Edrin said, too bright. "That went well."

"Did it?" Rachel asked.

No one answered.

They found an inn at the edge of the square—larger than the other buildings, with a sign depicting a tree Rachel didn't recognize. The trunk spiraled in on itself, branches spreading in mathematical patterns that looked almost fractal. The wood of the sign itself had that same spiral grain, and the paint used for the image had a slight luminescence, visible even in daylight.

Arathen negotiated rooms while the others waited in what passed for a common area. The floor was made of fitted stones that weren't quite level—intentionally, Rachel realized, creating subtle patterns in the surface that guided foot traffic without being obvious about it. A few locals occupied tables near the far wall, their conversations dying when Rachel's group entered, then resuming at lower volumes.

One man had eyes that caught the light strangely—not quite cat-like, but reflecting more than human eyes should. Rachel tried not to stare, reminded herself that "human" might mean something different here, might include variations she'd been raised to think impossible.

Rachel sat with her back to the wall and watched Maelin organize their new supplies with methodical efficiency. Edrin had pulled out a small journal and was making notes about something. Ilyra stood near the window, attention fixed outside with the same focus she'd shown in the shop.

"You're thinking too loud again," Ilyra said without turning.

"Am I?"

"You want to ask why the shopkeeper reacted that way."

Rachel's hands curled against her thighs. "Yes."

"Could be a dozen reasons," Ilyra said. "Could be she sensed something about you. Could be she's had bad experiences with people who look at her the way you do."

"How do I look at people?"

Ilyra finally turned. "Like you're expecting them to see through you."

The observation landed with uncomfortable accuracy.

Arathen returned with keys and the information that they'd have two rooms for the night. "We leave at first light," he said. "Rest while you can."

Rachel accepted her share of dried fruit from Maelin's distribution and ate without tasting it. Around them, the inn settled into evening routines—food served, conversations rising and falling, the particular quality of sound that came from strangers sharing space.

She'd done this a thousand times in her old life. Restaurants. Coffee shops. Airports. Being around people who didn't know her, didn't need to know her, who existed in parallel without intersection.

It had never felt like this.

Like she was performing humanity instead of living it.

Later, in the room she shared with Maelin and Ilyra, Rachel lay on the narrow bed and stared at ceiling beams that caught shadows in their grain—that spiral grain that seemed universal in this world's wood, as if all trees grew twisted. The mattress beneath her was stuffed with something that wasn't quite straw, softer and with a faint herbal scent that wasn't unpleasant but wasn't familiar either. Through the window, she could see two moons rising—one larger and pale silver, the other smaller and faintly blue, both casting overlapping shadows that made the night outside look layered, dimensional in ways that hurt to look at too long.

Maelin's breathing had evened into sleep. Ilyra sat near the window, keeping watch in her particular way—not actively looking, just aware.

"Does it get easier?" Rachel asked quietly. "Being around people who don't know?"

Ilyra was silent long enough that Rachel thought she might not answer.

"No," she said finally. "But you get better at carrying it."

Rachel closed her eyes and tried to believe that would be enough.

Outside, the town breathed around them. Ordinary people living ordinary lives, unaware that something not-quite-ordinary lay awake in their inn, wondering what it meant that she'd never felt more like an imposter than when trying to be herself.
