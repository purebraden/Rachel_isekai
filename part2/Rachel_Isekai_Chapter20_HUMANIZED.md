## Chapter Twenty

Sleep wouldn't come.

Rachel lay in her bedroll and listened to the others breathe their way into rest—Maelin's soft sighs, Edrin's occasional snore, Ilyra's deliberate stillness that might have been sleep or might have been perfect control. The fire had burned down to coals, just enough light to suggest shapes without defining them.

Her mind wouldn't quiet.

The bird. The stones. The branch embedded in the tree. Her hands doing impossible things with impossible ease. Arathen's voice saying _You're not fighting against time. You're negotiating with it._

And time was saying yes.

Rachel sat up slowly, carefully, trying not to disturb anyone. Her body protested—sore from travel, from sleeping on ground, from existing in a world that asked more of her physically than her old life ever had. She pulled her blanket around her shoulders and stood, bare feet finding grass cold with night moisture. The bioluminescent moss around the fire pit's edge pulsed faintly with her footsteps, responding to pressure or vibration. Both moons hung overhead, the larger silver one nearly full, the smaller blue one a crescent, and their combined light made everything look layered, dimensional.

Arathen sat at the edge of camp, back against a tree, attention fixed on something Rachel couldn't see. Not sleeping. Keeping watch, maybe. Or just choosing not to rest while his mind worked through problems she could only guess at.

He turned slightly as she approached, unsurprised by her presence. Like he'd been expecting her.

"Can't sleep?" he asked quietly.

"No."

He gestured to the space beside him. Rachel sat, arranging her blanket, putting herself at an angle where they could see each other without the intensity of direct confrontation. The forest stretched before them, darkness layered with deeper darkness. Those bell-flowers had opened slightly—she could hear their faint chiming in the night breeze, a sound like distant music. Something glowed in the undergrowth, bioluminescence marking paths or territories or something else entirely. The air smelled of that persistent herbal sharpness, mixed with the clean smoke from their dying fire.

"What are you thinking about?" Arathen asked.

Rachel considered lying. Deflecting. Performing the kind of social maintenance she'd spent twenty-six years perfecting. But exhaustion had worn her defenses thin, and this was Arathen, who already knew most of her truths anyway.

"I'm thinking about how easy it was," she said. "Stopping the bird. Moving the stones. All of it. It should have been hard. Should have taken concentration, effort. But it just... happened. Like breathing."

"And that frightens you," he said. Not a question.

"Yes." She pulled the blanket tighter. "I've spent my whole life feeling like I had to work twice as hard to be half as good. At work, in relationships, just existing. Everything was effort. And now—" She gestured helplessly. "Now I have power I didn't ask for, doing things that should be impossible, and it's the easiest thing I've ever done."

Arathen was quiet for a moment. When he spoke, his voice was careful. "What if that's not a contradiction? What if it's confirmation?"

Rachel looked at him.

"You struggled," he continued, "because you were trying to be something you weren't. Fit into a shape that didn't match your edges. You worked twice as hard because you were fighting against your own nature." He paused. "And now you're not. Now you're doing what you were built to do. So it feels easy because it is easy. For you."

The words landed with uncomfortable precision.

"That's a terrifying thought," Rachel said.

"Why?"

"Because it means everything before was wrong. My whole life, every choice I made, every version of myself I tried to be—all of it was just me failing to be human correctly."

Arathen's voice softened. "Or it was you trying very hard to be something you're not. Which isn't failure. It's survival."

Rachel pressed her palms against her eyes. "What am I, Arathen?"

"I think you know."

"I want to hear you say it."

He shifted, turning to face her more fully. The coals cast just enough light to outline his features—the lines around his eyes, the silver threading through his hair, the expression that held more compassion than she'd expected.

The words came out steady, certain. "I think you're a demon. Or something very close to one. A boundary walker who was born in the wrong world. Someone who should have grown up knowing what they were, but didn't. Who spent twenty-six years trying to be human when that was never what you were meant to be."

Rachel had known he'd say it. Had been building toward this understanding for days. But hearing it spoken aloud still felt like falling.

"Demons are supposed to be evil," she said. "Dangerous."

"Who told you that?" Arathen asked. "Because it's not true. Demons are just beings who exist according to different rules. Some are dangerous. Some are kind. Most are just trying to live their lives, same as anyone else."

"But I don't know the rules," Rachel said. "I don't know what I'm supposed to be, how I'm supposed to exist. I'm just—" Her voice cracked. "I'm just making it up as I go and hoping I don't destroy something important by accident."

"That's called learning," Arathen said. "Everyone does it. You're just learning a curriculum you should have started years ago."

"What if I hurt someone?" Rachel whispered. "What if I lose control and—"

"You won't," Arathen said, certainty in his voice.

"You don't know that."

"I do, actually." He leaned back against the tree, eyes never leaving hers. "Rachel, I've been studying boundary magic and temporal manipulation for thirty years. I've seen people with a fraction of your power destroy everything around them because they couldn't control it. You have more ability than anyone I've ever encountered, and you're exercising a level of control that shouldn't be possible for someone so new to their abilities."

"That doesn't comfort me," Rachel said.

"It should," he replied. "Because it means whatever you are, whoever you are at your core—you're someone who chooses caution. Who values the people around you more than your own power. That's not a small thing."

He paused, then added more thoughtfully, "And your range is expanding. Have you noticed? The small boundary repairs you're doing instinctively—they're affecting larger areas now. Wider scope. When we first started traveling, you could sense thin places within a few feet. Now you're reading boundaries across the entire camp radius." His expression was both impressed and concerned. "That kind of growth is exponential. In another week, you might be affecting boundary stability across hundreds of yards without conscious effort."

"Is that dangerous?" Rachel asked.

Arathen chose his words with visible thought. "It's unprecedented. Which means I don't know. But it suggests your power isn't just growing—it's expanding its reach. Learning to work at scale without needing you to actively direct it." He met her eyes. "If that progression continues, you might be capable of manipulating boundaries across much larger areas than either of us anticipated."

The implications settled uneasily in Rachel's stomach. She'd been thinking of her abilities as personal, contained. The idea that they might scale up without her conscious control was both fascinating and terrifying.

Rachel looked at her hands. Ordinary hands. Human-looking hands. Hands that had stopped a bird's heart and let it resume like nothing had happened. Hands that were apparently learning to affect reality at scales she couldn't yet comprehend.

"I feel like an imposter," she said. "Even now. Even knowing what I probably am. I look at Maelin and Edrin and Ilyra and you, and you're all so clearly yourselves. And I'm just—" She struggled for the word. "Hollow. Like I'm performing existence instead of living it."

Arathen's hand found her shoulder. "That feeling is what happens when you spend twenty-six years pretending to be something you're not. It's going to take time to unlearn. To figure out who Rachel is when she's not trying to fit into a human-shaped space."

"What if I don't like who that is?"

Arathen's expression gentled. "What if you do?"

The question hung between them. Rachel turned it over, testing its weight, its implications. What if she did like who she was when she stopped pretending? What if this version—the one who could bend reality, who could see boundaries, who belonged to the spaces between worlds—what if this was the version she was supposed to be all along?

"I'm scared," she admitted.

"I know," Arathen said. "That's why you'll be careful. That's why you'll learn instead of assuming. That's why—" He paused, something shifting in his expression. "That's why you're going to be okay."

The certainty in his voice made Rachel's chest tighten. "You don't know that."

"I know you," he said. "I've watched you. Seen how you think, how you choose. You're cautious to the point of self-sacrifice. You care more about not hurting others than you care about your own comfort. That's not going to change just because you discover you have power."

"Power changes people," Rachel said.

"Power reveals people," Arathen corrected. "And you've been revealed as someone who stops to make sure the bird is okay after using it as a test subject. Someone who apologizes for taking up space even when no one's asked you to shrink. That's who you are. That's who you'll continue to be."

Rachel found herself smiling despite everything. "You're very certain about a person you've known less than two weeks."

"I'm very good at reading people," he said. "It's my job."

"And what do you read in me?"

The question came out more vulnerable than she'd intended. More honest. More revealing.

Arathen was quiet for a long moment, gaze searching her face in the dim light. When he spoke, his voice had changed—softer, more personal than professional.

"I see someone who's been alone her entire life and is only just starting to realize she doesn't have to be anymore," he said. "Someone who's stronger than she knows and kinder than she believes. Someone who's been taught to think of herself as too much and not enough at the same time, when the truth is she's exactly who she's supposed to be." He paused. "And I see someone who's terrified that if people really knew her, they'd leave. When the reality is, we already know you. And we're still here."

Rachel's vision blurred. She blinked hard against tears she hadn't given permission to form.

"That's a very nice speech," she managed.

"It's also true," Arathen said.

They sat in silence, the space between them both comfortable and charged with something Rachel didn't have words for. Not attraction exactly—though maybe that too, she wasn't sure, couldn't parse her own feelings through the chaos of everything else. But connection. Recognition. The particular intimacy that came from being seen and choosing not to hide.

"Thank you," Rachel said finally. "For not lying to me. For not pretending this is all going to be simple."

"It won't be simple," Arathen agreed. "But that doesn't mean it has to be impossible."

Rachel pulled her knees up, wrapped her arms around them, made herself smaller in a gesture she'd probably learned in childhood and never unlearned. Arathen noticed—she could see him notice—but he didn't comment. Just shifted slightly, closing some of the physical distance between them without actually touching.

"When we get to Thornhaven," Rachel said, "when I meet Sivara—will she know? Just by looking at me?"

"Probably," Arathen said. "Demons recognize each other. It's not something you can hide, not from someone who knows what to look for."

"What if she doesn't want to help?" Rachel asked. "What if she sees me and decides I'm a threat, or a mistake, or—"

"Rachel." Arathen's hand found hers in the dark. Just resting there, warm and solid. "One problem at a time. Right now, the problem is you're exhausted and not sleeping. Everything else can wait until tomorrow."

His hand on hers felt significant in a way Rachel couldn't articulate. Not romantic—or not only romantic. Just... present. Real. An anchor point when everything else felt unstable.

She didn't pull away.

They sat like that for a while, watching the darkness, not speaking. Eventually Rachel felt her breathing even out, her body remembering how to be tired instead of wired. The fear that had been pressing against her chest eased slightly.

Not gone. Just bearable.

"You should try to sleep," Arathen said finally. "Tomorrow's another long day."

"Are you going to sleep?" Rachel asked.

"Eventually," he said. "Someone should keep watch."

"That's not why you're not sleeping," Rachel said.

He glanced at her, eyebrow raised. "No?"

"No. You're not sleeping because your mind won't shut off any more than mine will. You're thinking about what I am, what that means, what happens next. How to keep everyone safe, including me." Rachel paused. "Am I wrong?"

Arathen's mouth quirked. "You're not wrong."

"Then we can both not-sleep together," Rachel said. "It's less lonely that way."

Something in his expression softened. "Alright."

They sat together in the darkness, hands still touching, neither sleeping but neither alone. The forest breathed around them—literally breathed, the bioluminescent patterns pulsing in slow rhythm like a collective heartbeat. The coals glowed their slow fade into ash, sparks occasionally flaring green before dying. Somewhere a night bird called—that four-winged creature or something like it, a sound Rachel didn't recognize but that felt appropriate anyway. The bell-flowers chimed their gentle accompaniment. The two moons tracked across a sky full of unfamiliar constellations.

She was a demon. Probably. A being who belonged to boundaries and spaces between worlds. Someone who'd spent twenty-six years trying to be human and failing not because she was inadequate, but because she'd been trying to be the wrong thing entirely.

That should have been devastating.

But sitting here, with Arathen's hand warm against hers and the knowledge that he saw her—really saw her—and hadn't turned away... it felt less like an ending and more like a beginning.

"Arathen?"

"Mm?"

"What you said earlier. About me being exactly who I'm supposed to be." She swallowed. "Did you mean that?"

He was quiet for a moment. Then his hand squeezed hers, gentle and deliberate.

"Yes," he said. "I meant it."

Rachel closed her eyes and let herself believe him.

Just for tonight, she let herself believe she might actually be enough.
