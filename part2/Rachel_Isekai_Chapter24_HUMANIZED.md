## Chapter Twenty-Four

Rachel dreamed of her old apartment.

Not the summoning—for once, not that. Just her apartment on a random Tuesday afternoon, light coming through windows that faced the wrong direction, traffic sounds muffled by double-pane glass that actually worked the way glass should. Her laptop open on the kitchen table. Coffee in a mug that said something supposedly inspirational that she'd always found vaguely condescending.

Normal. Aggressively, mundanely normal.

In the dream, she was packing. Moving boxes sat half-filled around the living room. She was folding clothes—the same clothes she'd been wearing when the summoning happened, which her dream brain found extremely significant though she couldn't articulate why.

Someone knocked on the door.

Rachel knew, with dream logic, that it was Evan. That he was there to help her move, or to talk her out of moving, or maybe just to be there because that's what partners did. She walked to the door. Put her hand on the knob.

Couldn't remember what he looked like.

The realization jolted her awake.

Rachel lay in her bedroll staring at unfamiliar stars, heart pounding, the dream already fragmenting but that one detail sharp and terrible: she couldn't remember Evan's face.

She tried now, fully awake. Tried to picture him clearly. His eyes had been... what color? Blue? No, brown. Maybe hazel? He'd had hair that did that thing where it flipped up in back no matter what product he used. Or was that someone else?

The specifics wouldn't come. She could remember facts—physical therapist, kind, conflict-averse, reliably present but rarely exciting. She could remember feelings—comfortable, safe, slightly suffocating. She could remember the shape of their relationship.

But his face. The specific arrangement of features that made him Evan instead of anyone else. That was gone.

Rachel's chest constricted. She'd been with him for two years. Two years of shared meals and shared space and shared life. And now, less than two weeks after leaving—after being torn away—she couldn't picture him clearly.

What did that say about her?

What did that say about them?

She sat up carefully, trying not to disturb Maelin sleeping nearby. The camp was quiet. Both moons hung low on the horizon, their light creating long shadows through the purple-wood trees. The bioluminescent patterns in the moss pulsed slowly, a heartbeat rhythm that Rachel's own pulse kept trying to match.

Arathen was on watch, sitting at the camp's edge with that same patient awareness he always carried. He noticed Rachel moving and turned slightly, a silent question.

Rachel stood and walked over to him, blanket wrapped around her shoulders against the night chill. He made space beside him without needing to be asked.

They sat in silence for a while. Comfortable silence, the kind that didn't demand filling.

Finally, Rachel spoke. "I can't remember what he looked like."

Arathen didn't need clarification about who "he" was. "Evan," he said quietly.

"Yes." Rachel pulled the blanket tighter. "I was just dreaming about him—about my old life—and I realized I couldn't see his face clearly anymore. I know facts about him. I know how I felt. But the actual him—" She shook her head. "It's fading."

"That's normal," Arathen said gently.

"Is it?" Rachel asked. "Normal for who? Humans? Demons? People who get kidnapped into other dimensions?"

"All of them," Arathen said. "Memory works differently when you're not reinforcing it. When you're not seeing someone daily, not actively maintaining that connection. Two weeks is long enough for details to start blurring, especially when you've been through the kind of trauma and change you have."

"It feels wrong," Rachel said. "Like I'm betraying him by forgetting. He's probably looking for me. Probably terrified about what happened. And I'm here, in another world, forgetting what his face looks like."

"You're surviving," Arathen said. "That's not betrayal. That's necessary."

Rachel looked at her hands. They looked the same as they always had, but she knew now they weren't. That they'd never been human hands, just hands that looked human because she'd been born in a human world and had adapted accordingly.

"I think I'm letting him go," she said quietly. "And I don't know if that's healthy or terrible or just practical."

"Why can't it be all three?" Arathen asked.

Rachel considered that. "I guess it can be."

"Do you want to remember him?" Arathen asked. "Clearly, I mean. We could work on it. Reconstruct details. I have techniques for memory preservation."

Rachel opened her mouth to say yes. Of course yes. She'd loved Evan—or thought she had, or had tried to, or whatever approximation of love she'd been capable of while pretending to be human. She owed him at least the courtesy of remembering his face.

But the word that came out was: "No."

Arathen didn't react with surprise. Just nodded slowly, like she'd confirmed something he'd suspected. The firelight caught the silver in his hair, made his eyes reflect like dark water.

"No," Rachel repeated, testing the word. "I don't want to work to remember him. Is that awful?"

"It's human," Arathen said quietly. His gaze held hers for a moment longer than necessary before he looked back at the fire. "People move on. Hearts change. You're allowed to let go of something that didn't fit."

Rachel pulled her knees up, resting her chin on them. "I think I'm realizing I didn't love him the way I thought I did. Or the way I was supposed to. He was... convenient. Safe. Proof that I could have a normal relationship like normal people do." She paused. "But I wasn't normal. And trying to be normal made everything feel hollow."

"Including him," Arathen said.

"Including him," Rachel agreed. "Which isn't fair to him. He deserved someone who loved him fully, not someone who was using him as evidence of normalcy."

"You didn't know you were doing that," Arathen pointed out.

"Does that make it better?" Rachel asked.

"It makes it understandable," he said. "You can't be blamed for trying to fit into the only world you knew. You were doing your best with the information you had."

Rachel thought about Evan. About his earnest attempts to understand her, to connect with her, to build a life together. About her equally earnest attempts to meet him halfway while never quite feeling like she was succeeding.

"He deserves to know I'm not coming back," she said. "Even if I could find a way, even if it were possible—I'm not going back to that life. To pretending. He deserves someone who isn't pretending."

"Yes," Arathen said simply.

They sat with that truth. Rachel waited for guilt, for grief, for the emotional devastation that should come with realizing you're letting go of someone who'd been central to your life for two years.

What she felt instead was relief.

And beneath that: freedom.

"I'm a terrible person," she said.

"You're not." Arathen shifted closer, just slightly, and Rachel felt the warmth of him in the cool night air. "You're someone who's finally stopped apologizing for wanting something real. That takes courage, Rachel. Not cruelty."

"It doesn't feel brave," Rachel said. "It feels like I'm abandoning him. Like I'm taking the easy way out."

"There's nothing easy about what you're doing." His voice had gone softer, and when Rachel looked up, she found him watching her with an intensity that made her breath catch. "Nothing easy about any of this. You're just making the choice that's true instead of the choice that looks right from the outside."

Rachel couldn't look away. Couldn't pretend she didn't notice the way his attention felt different lately—more focused, more intentional. The space between them felt charged, like the air before a storm.

Rachel turned that over in her mind. True versus right. They weren't the same thing, were they? Right was what you were supposed to do. True was what actually aligned with reality.

"I wish I could tell him," she said. "That I'm okay. That this isn't his fault. That he should move on and find someone who can love him the way he deserves."

"Maybe you can," Arathen said. "Someday. When we have more answers about how boundaries work, about what's possible. But Rachel—" He waited until she looked at him. "You don't owe him your life. You don't owe anyone that. Not even out of guilt."

"I know," Rachel said. "Intellectually, I know. But the feeling—"

"Will take time to catch up," Arathen finished. "That's normal too."

They sat in silence again. Above them, the smaller blue moon had set, leaving only the large silver one to light the forest. The shadows shifted, became deeper. Somewhere in the distance, one of those four-winged birds called—a sound that was becoming familiar now, almost comforting in its strangeness.

"Can I ask you something?" Rachel said.

"Always," Arathen replied.

"If I had stayed human—if I'd somehow actually been human instead of a demon who didn't know it—would you have looked at me the same way?"

The question hung between them. Rachel wasn't entirely sure what she was asking. Wasn't entirely sure she wanted the answer.

Arathen was quiet for a long moment. "I don't know," he said finally. "Because I never saw you as human. From the first moment, from before I even met you—Edrin's message said you were manifesting abilities you shouldn't have. I came expecting someone extraordinary. And you were."

"Are," Rachel corrected quietly. "I am."

"Yes," Arathen agreed. "You are."

Something in his tone made Rachel's chest tighten. Not romantic exactly—or not only romantic. Just... significant. Weighty. The kind of moment that would look different in retrospect than it felt in real-time.

"I should try to sleep," Rachel said, though she didn't move.

"You should," Arathen agreed, though he didn't suggest she leave.

Rachel looked at the forest, at the unfamiliar trees and the impossible light and the creatures that moved in shadows cast by moons that weren't her moons. Looked at the life she'd stumbled into, been dragged into, been summoned into without choice or preparation.

Looked at the person beside her who'd seen her at her most impossible and had chosen understanding over fear.

"Arathen?" she said.

"Mm?"

"The resonance effect," she said. "The one you warned me about. The timer that meant the longer I stayed here, the harder it would be to return." She paused. "I can feel it. It's not pulling anymore. It's settled. Like this world has decided I belong here and stopped trying to integrate me."

"Because you are a demon," Arathen said quietly. "Boundary walkers don't need to integrate. We're already part of the spaces between. The resonance wasn't trying to trap you. It was trying to wake you up."

"And now I'm awake," Rachel said.

"Now you're awake," he agreed. "Which means the timer is gone. You could try to return, theoretically, though I don't know if it's possible. But the pressure to stay, the resonance pulling you deeper—that's done. You're stabilized."

The information should have brought relief. Instead it just confirmed what Rachel already knew in her bones.

"Thank you. For not making this easier than it is. For not pretending I should feel something I don't."

"You're welcome," he said simply.

Rachel stood, blanket still wrapped around her shoulders. Arathen's hand brushed hers as she turned—so briefly it might have been accident—and then she was walking back to her bedroll, back to the space between waking and sleeping where Evan's face had faded and her real life had finally begun.

She lay down. Closed her eyes. Tried to summon guilt or grief or any of the emotions that should accompany letting someone go.

Found only relief.

Only freedom.

Only the truth that she'd been alone in that relationship from the beginning, and leaving it—even accidentally, even unwillingly—was the kindest thing she could have done for both of them.

Rachel's last thought before sleep was this: She'd spent twenty-six years building a life that fit wrong.

Now she was building one that fit right.

And if that meant letting go of everything she'd thought she was, everyone she'd thought she loved, every future she'd imagined—

Well.

Some things were worth letting go of.

Some things were necessary to release before you could hold onto what actually mattered.

Rachel slept.

The nightmare came swiftly.

Not Evan this time. Not her apartment. This was different—darker, more invasive. She stood in boundary space, the layered reality of the Sethril crossing, but wrong. Corrupted. Something moved through the layers toward her, hunting.

A presence. Powerful. Ancient. Hungry.

It reached for her through the dream, trying to locate her physical form, map her location through the connection between sleeping mind and waking world. Boundary magic turned weapon.

Rachel felt it touch her awareness and recoiled.

"Found you," a voice said. Not spoken. Impressed directly into her mind. Vex. She recognized his power signature from the watcher weeks ago.

He was trying to track her through dreams.

Rachel's instincts flared. In the dream, her power responded—boundaries snapping shut around her consciousness, creating shields that shouldn't be possible in sleep. She pushed back against Vex's intrusion, forcing him out of her dream space.

"Interesting," Vex's voice echoed as he withdrew. "You're stronger than expected. Even asleep, you defend. We'll meet soon, little heir. And when we do—"

Rachel woke gasping.

Her power was crackling along her boundaries, visible to anyone looking—blue-white light flickering across her hands. Maelin was awake instantly, alarmed.

"Rachel? What's wrong?"

Rachel tried to calm her breathing, to pull her power back under control. "Someone tried to track me. Through my dream. Demon nightmare magic."

Arathen was there in seconds, still on watch. "Describe it."

Rachel told him. About the dream, the presence, the attempt to locate her physically through the sleeping connection.

"That's advanced technique," Arathen said grimly. "And illegal in most territories. Dream invasion requires the target to be vulnerable, unguarded." He looked at Rachel with mixed concern and pride. "You defended yourself. While unconscious. That's remarkable."

"That's terrifying," Rachel corrected. "I was asleep and still had to fight. When am I supposed to be safe?"

"Not until we reach Thornhaven," Ilyra said. She'd woken too, knife already in hand. "Whoever's tracking you—they're escalating. First observation, then boundary creatures as distraction, now active dream assault. They're testing your defenses, learning your capabilities."

"And confirming your location," Edrin added quietly. He'd joined them, looking worried. "Dream tracking has limited range. Whoever did this knows roughly where we are."

Maelin moved closer to Rachel. "Did you recognize them?"

Rachel nodded slowly. "The power signature. It felt like... the watcher. The one who's been following us. But stronger. Like he was showing me what he's really capable of."

"Vex," Arathen said with certainty. "He's done being subtle. He wants you to know he's coming."

Rachel pulled her blanket tighter despite the crackling power still warming her hands. "How much farther to Thornhaven?"

"One day if we push hard," Arathen said. "Maybe a day and a half if we have to be cautious. Depends on whether we're tracked again, whether they try another assault."

"They will," Ilyra said flatly. "They're committed now."

Rachel looked around at them—all awake now, all alert, all ready to protect her from threats that came even in sleep.

"I'm sorry," she said. "For bringing this down on you. For—"

"Stop," Maelin said firmly. "We chose to come with you. We choose to stay. That's not your fault."

"Get some rest," Arathen said gently. "I'll keep watch. If anything tries to reach you again through dreams, I'll wake you immediately."

Rachel lay back down, but sleep felt dangerous now. Like giving Vex another opening. Another chance to find her.

But exhaustion won eventually.

And for the first time since the summoning, she didn't dream of home.

She dreamed of nothing at all.

And that, at least, felt safe.
