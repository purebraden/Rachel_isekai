## Chapter Twenty-Five

Morning came with birdsong that was almost right—four-winged creatures calling to each other in patterns that were starting to sound like music instead of noise. Rachel woke feeling lighter than she had in days, which was strange considering she'd spent half the night realizing she was letting go of her former life without regret.

Maybe that was why she felt lighter.

They broke camp efficiently. The rhythm of it had become second nature—rolling bedrolls, distributing supplies, checking that nothing was left behind. Rachel found herself moving through the routine without thought, muscle memory adapting to this life faster than her conscious mind had.

The forest today was different again. The purple-wood trees had given way to something that looked almost like ash—pale gray bark, silver leaves that made a sound like paper rustling when the wind moved through them. The undergrowth was sparse here, just silvery moss and clusters of white flowers that closed when anyone got too near.

The path remained clear though. Those deliberate white stones marking the safe route through territory Rachel didn't fully understand but was learning to respect.

They walked for hours. Not rushed, but steady. The kind of pace that ate distance without exhausting. Rachel's body had adapted to travel in ways that surprised her—she no longer got blisters, her muscles no longer screamed after full days of walking, her breathing stayed even on inclines that should have left her winded.

Demon benefits, she supposed. A body that wasn't quite human, wasn't quite bound by human limitations.

It should have felt wrong. Alien. Proof that she wasn't who she'd thought she was.

Instead, it felt like finally working correctly after years of glitching.

They stopped for midday rest in a clearing where the silver-leaved trees created a natural canopy, light filtering through in patterns that almost looked intentional. Rachel sat with her back against smooth gray bark and ate rations that were becoming familiar—dried fruit that tasted like apples mixed with something citrus, bread that stayed fresh longer than bread should, and water from a stream that ran clearer than physics suggested was possible.

Maelin settled beside her, close enough that their shoulders brushed.

They ate in comfortable silence for a while. Around them, the others spread out—Edrin immediately absorbed in his journal, Ilyra doing her systematic scan of the perimeter, Arathen consulting that brass-and-glass device and making small adjustments to their planned route.

"You seem different today," Maelin said finally.

Rachel glanced at her. "Different how?"

"Lighter," Maelin said. "Less like you're carrying something heavy. Or like you set something down."

Rachel considered denying it. Then remembered she was done pretending. "I let someone go last night. In my head. Someone I left behind."

"The boyfriend," Maelin said. Not a question.

"Yes," Rachel confirmed. "I realized I couldn't remember what he looked like anymore. And when I tried to feel guilty about that, I just... couldn't. I felt relieved instead."

Maelin nodded slowly. "That makes sense."

"Does it?" Rachel asked. "Because it feels selfish. He's probably terrified about what happened to me, and I'm here thinking 'well, that's over, time to move on.'"

"You're not thinking that," Maelin said gently. "You're thinking 'I was never happy there, and I'm not going back to unhappiness just because it's familiar.'"

The accuracy of it made Rachel's chest tight. "Yes," she admitted. "Exactly that."

They sat with that for a moment. The silver leaves rustled overhead, creating patterns of light and shadow that moved across the ground like breathing. One of those white flowers had opened near Rachel's feet—either she'd sat still long enough that it no longer registered her as a threat, or it was curiosity overriding caution.

"Can I ask you something?" Maelin said. Her voice had changed slightly, gone careful in a way that suggested the question mattered.

"Always," Rachel said.

"Do you want to go home?"

The question landed heavier than Rachel had expected. Not because it was surprising—she'd been dancing around it for days—but because Maelin was asking it directly, without qualification or softening.

Do you want to go home.

Rachel looked at the forest around her. At the silver leaves and gray bark and white flowers that closed when you got too close. At Edrin absorbed in scholarship that mattered, Ilyra moving with purpose through a world she understood, Arathen studying problems that were actually solvable instead of just endurable.

At Maelin beside her, patient and present and accepting of exactly who Rachel was.

"No," Rachel said. The word came out quieter than she'd intended but no less certain for it. "No, I don't want to go home."

Maelin didn't react with surprise. Just nodded once, like Rachel had confirmed something instead of revealing it. "Why not?"

Rachel tried to find words for feelings she'd been avoiding examining too closely. "Because home wasn't home. It was just where I was. Where I was trying very hard to fit into a shape that didn't match my edges." She paused. "Every day there felt like work. Like I was maintaining a performance. And I was so tired, Maelin. So tired of pretending to be someone I wasn't."

"And here?" Maelin asked.

"Here I'm terrified half the time," Rachel admitted. "I don't understand most of what's happening. I have powers I don't know how to control and responsibilities I never asked for. I'm constantly reminded that I don't belong to the species I thought I did."

"But?" Maelin prompted gently.

"But I feel real," Rachel said. "Like I'm actually living instead of just existing. Like the things I do matter, the choices I make have weight. Even when I'm scared, even when I'm exhausted—it feels honest. True. Like I'm finally being myself after twenty-six years of being a very convincing imitation."

Maelin's hand found Rachel's, warm and solid. "That's not selfish," she said firmly. "That's survival. That's choosing life over existence. No one can blame you for that."

"I can," Rachel said. "I do. Because what kind of person leaves behind everyone they knew, everything they built, and just... doesn't miss it? Doesn't want to go back?"

"The kind of person who was never happy there," Maelin said. "The kind who was drowning slowly and didn't even know it until someone pulled them out." She squeezed Rachel's hand. "You're allowed to not want to go back to drowning, Rachel. Even if the water was familiar."

Rachel's vision blurred. She blinked hard against tears she hadn't given permission to form. "What if we figure out how to send me back? What if there's a way?"

"Then you'll have a choice," Maelin said simply. "And you'll make whatever choice is right for you. But Rachel—" She waited until Rachel looked at her. "You don't have to choose suffering just because it's what you're used to. You're allowed to choose happiness. You're allowed to choose belonging."

"I barely know you," Rachel said, throat tight. "All of you. It's been less than two weeks. How can this feel more like home than twenty-six years of actual home?"

"Because it is home," Maelin said. "Not the place. The people. The feeling of being seen and accepted instead of tolerated. That's home. And time doesn't matter as much as you think it does."

Rachel let the tears fall. Not many, just enough to acknowledge the weight of what she was admitting. "I'm not going back," she said. "Even if we find a way. Even if it's possible. I'm not going back."

"Okay," Maelin said.

"Just okay?" Rachel asked.

"Just okay," Maelin confirmed. "You don't need permission, Rachel. You don't need anyone to tell you your choice is valid. You get to decide where you belong."

"I belong here," Rachel said. Testing the words. Finding them true.

"Yes," Maelin agreed. "You do."

They sat with that truth. Around them, the forest continued its strange rhythms—flowers opening and closing, leaves rustling in patterns that suggested language, light moving across ground in ways that defied normal physics. This world that Rachel had been dragged into without consent, without preparation, without any of the tools she'd need to navigate it successfully.

This world that had become more real to her than the one she'd left behind.

Edrin appeared, his journal tucked under one arm. "We should keep moving. Another few hours and we'll reach the outer markers for Thornhaven territory. We'll camp just outside tonight, enter properly tomorrow morning."

"Tomorrow," Rachel repeated. Tomorrow they'd reach Thornhaven. Tomorrow she'd meet Sivara. Tomorrow she'd get actual answers about what she was, what that meant, how to live as this thing she'd discovered herself to be.

Tomorrow everything would change again.

But for today, for this moment, Rachel let herself just be. Be scared and excited and certain and uncertain all at once. Be someone who'd chosen a new life over the old one, who'd let go of who she thought she should be in favor of who she actually was.

Be, for maybe the first time, exactly herself.

They walked through the afternoon, the silver-leaf forest gradually transitioning into something else—trees with copper-colored bark and leaves that were almost purple-black, undergrowth that included plants Rachel had no names for but that smelled like sage and mint and something sweeter.

The air changed too. Became charged, electric, like the feeling before a storm but without the actual storm. Magic, Rachel realized. Ambient magic thick enough to taste, to feel against her skin like humidity.

"Thornhaven territory," Arathen confirmed, consulting his device. "We're on the border. From here forward, we're guests."

"Whose guests?" Ilyra asked.

"Technically? The regional council's. Practically? Sivara's. She has significant influence here." Arathen looked at Rachel. "Which means from this point forward, you're under her protection. Whether she knows it yet or not."

Rachel wasn't sure how to feel about that. Protection implied safety, but it also implied debt. Obligation. Nothing was free, not even sanctuary.

They found a campsite just beyond the final marker stone—still technically outside Thornhaven proper but close enough that the boundary was visible if Rachel concentrated. Not a physical boundary. A magical one. A line of intention that said "here begins somewhere distinct."

Camp assembled itself. Fire got built. Dinner got prepared. The familiar rhythms of an evening that Rachel had started to count on. Stars began appearing overhead—wrong stars, in wrong patterns, but stars nonetheless. The two moons rose—large silver, small blue—and Rachel found herself thinking of them as her moons now instead of wrong moons.

Her sky. Her world. Her life.

After dinner, after the others had settled into their various evening routines, Rachel found herself standing at the edge of camp, looking toward where Thornhaven lay just beyond her perception. Tomorrow they'd enter. Tomorrow everything would shift again, reveal new truths, demand new adaptations.

But tonight, she was here. Between one thing and another. Not human anymore but not fully demon yet. Not from this world but not able to return to her old one. Caught in the space between, which maybe was exactly where a boundary walker was supposed to be.

"Thinking too loud again," Arathen said, appearing beside her.

Rachel smiled. "Is that going to be your standard observation?"

"If you're going to keep doing it, yes," he replied.

They stood together in comfortable silence, watching the dark forest breathe its bioluminescent patterns, listening to the bell-flowers chime their evening song.

"I told Maelin today that I don't want to go back," Rachel said. "To my old world. My old life. Even if we figure out how."

"I know," Arathen said. "She told me."

Rachel glanced at him. "Did she?"

"We talk," he said simply. "About you, among other things. We worry. We plan. We try to figure out how to help someone who's navigating something none of us fully understand."

"I appreciate that," Rachel said. "The worrying. The planning. All of it."

"Do you regret it?" Arathen asked. "Coming here. Everything that happened after."

Rachel thought about it honestly. Thought about her apartment, her job, her relationship, her carefully constructed life that had fit wrong from the beginning. Thought about power and terror and belonging and found family and magic that responded to her like recognition.

"No," she said. "I don't regret it. Which probably makes me a terrible person, but I don't."

"It doesn't make you terrible," Arathen said. "It makes you honest."

They stood a while longer. The night deepened. The moons climbed higher. The forest settled into its nocturnal rhythms—creatures calling to each other in voices that were becoming familiar, plants opening or closing according to schedules Rachel didn't yet understand but was learning to recognize.

"Tomorrow we meet Sivara," Rachel said.

"Tomorrow," Arathen confirmed.

"Are you nervous?" Rachel asked.

"Terrified," Arathen admitted. "But hopeful. She'll have answers. Real ones. Not speculation or theory. Actual knowledge about what you are and how to help you be it safely."

"That's all I want," Rachel said. "To be what I am. Without hurting anyone. Without breaking everything I touch."

"You won't," Arathen said with certainty.

"You keep saying that," Rachel said.

"I keep meaning it," he replied.

Rachel looked at him—really looked. At the lines around his eyes that suggested age and experience. At the silver threading through his hair that caught moonlight. At the expression he wore when he looked at her, something between concern and fascination and warmth that made her chest tight.

"Thank you," she said. "For coming to help. For staying. For not giving up when I'm difficult."

"You're not difficult," Arathen said. "You're learning. There's a difference."

Rachel laughed softly. "I'll try to remember that."

They walked back to camp together. To the fire and the friends and the temporary home they'd built in the space between where they'd been and where they were going.

Tomorrow would bring answers.

Tonight brought peace.

And Rachel, for the first time since the summoning, let herself believe that maybe—just maybe—everything was going to be okay.

Not easy. Not simple. Not anything like she'd imagined her life would be.

But okay.

In the ways that actually mattered.

In the ways that were true.
