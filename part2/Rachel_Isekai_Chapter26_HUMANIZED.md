## Chapter Twenty-Six

Thornhaven announced itself differently than Merridan's Cross had.

There were no gradual signs of habitation, no cleared spaces seeping into wilderness. The boundary between forest and town was abrupt—one moment walking through copper-barked trees, the next standing at the edge of something that looked less like a settlement and more like an agreement between architecture and nature that neither side had won.

The buildings weren't built so much as grown. Or maybe carved from living things that had been convinced to hold new shapes. Walls that were clearly wood but also clearly structural. Roofs that were leaves but had been woven into something that repelled weather. Streets that were packed earth but followed curves that suggested water flow more than city planning.

And everywhere—everywhere—that feeling of magic. Thick enough to taste, to feel against skin like static electricity, to hear as a low hum that existed just below conscious perception.

Rachel stopped at the boundary marker—a stone carved with symbols that made her eyes hurt if she looked directly at them—and stared.

"It's a lot," Maelin said quietly beside her.

"That's an understatement," Rachel managed.

The town spread out before them, easily ten times the size of Merridan's Cross. Hundreds of buildings arranged in patterns that looked random from ground level but probably made perfect sense from above. People moving through streets with the unhurried purpose of daily routine—but not all of them were people. Not entirely. Not the way Rachel had understood people.

She saw someone with skin that had bark texture, someone else whose hair moved like water even in still air, a child whose eyes were just slightly too large and reflected light like a cat's. Not human. Or not entirely human. Or human plus something else, something that didn't exist in Rachel's old world because her old world's rules wouldn't allow it.

"Mixed population," Arathen said, following her gaze. "Humans, part-demons, boundary crossers who've chosen to settle here. Thornhaven's always been a haven for those who don't quite fit elsewhere."

"So I'll fit right in," Rachel said, trying for levity and not quite managing it.

"You will," Arathen said, and he wasn't joking.

They entered the town proper. The boundary marker's resistance—that sense of crossing a threshold, of being noticed and assessed—gave way to acceptance. Whatever magic guarded Thornhaven had decided they were permitted entry.

The streets were wider than Rachel had expected, and cleaner. The packed earth had been treated with something that kept dust down, kept mud from forming even after rain. The buildings that lined them varied wildly in style—some looked almost traditionally human, others were clearly demon-made, still others existed in that space between that Rachel was starting to recognize as boundary work.

People noticed them. Of course people noticed them—new arrivals always drew attention. But the quality of attention was different here than in Merridan's Cross. Less wariness, more curiosity. A few people nodded in greeting as they passed. One woman with vine-like patterns growing across her arms smiled and said something in a language Rachel didn't understand, though her tone was clearly welcoming.

"She said 'safe paths,'" Arathen translated. "It's a common greeting here."

"Safe paths," Rachel repeated, testing the words in her mouth. They felt significant somehow. Appropriate for a town that existed at boundary crossings, where paths between worlds might intersect.

They walked deeper into Thornhaven. The architecture grew more complex—buildings that were definitely multiple stories, structures that couldn't exist according to Earth physics but clearly did according to whatever rules governed this place. A tower that spiraled upward in defiance of load-bearing principles. A bridge that arched between buildings at the third-story level, made of something that looked like glass but couldn't be.

And the people. So many people. More diversity in race and species and in-between states than Rachel's mind knew how to categorize. Someone walked past with feathers growing from their shoulders like a cloak. Someone else had eyes that were clearly functional but also clearly not positioned where human eyes should be.

Rachel tried not to stare. Tried to treat the impossible as ordinary, the way everyone else seemed to.

"This way," Arathen said, guiding them down a side street that was less crowded. "We need to find lodging first. Then we'll inquire about Sivara."

"Inquire?" Ilyra asked. "I thought you knew where she lived."

"I know she lives in Thornhaven," Arathen said. "I don't know exactly where. And approaching a demon without proper introduction is... inadvisable."

"So we need someone to introduce us," Edrin said, understanding. "Someone who knows both her and us."

"Or someone who owes us a favor," Arathen said. He'd been scanning the buildings as they walked, looking for something specific. "Ah. There."

He pointed to a building that looked more human than most—proper walls, proper roof, a sign hanging above the door depicting what might have been a bed or might have been something else entirely. An inn, Rachel assumed.

Inside was blessedly familiar. Common room with tables, stairs leading up to what were probably guest rooms, a counter where a man stood doing something that involved ledgers and coin. The man looked up as they entered, his expression shifting through assessment to recognition.

"Arathen," he said. His voice had a quality that suggested age despite his face looking relatively young. "It's been a year at least."

"Closer to two," Arathen agreed. "Jareth. We need rooms. Five people, at least two nights, possibly more."

Jareth's eyes moved over their group, lingering on Rachel longer than the others. Not threatening. Just noting. "Two rooms should suffice. Unless your arrangements require more privacy."

"Two is fine," Arathen said.

Coin changed hands—Rachel still didn't fully understand the currency system, but Arathen seemed confident in the exchange. Jareth produced keys that weren't quite metal, keys that seemed to shimmer slightly in certain light.

"Rooms three and four, upstairs," Jareth said. "Baths at the end of the hall, meals served at sunrise and sunset, additional food available for coin." He paused. "You're looking for Sivara."

It wasn't a question.

Arathen's expression stayed carefully neutral. "What makes you think that?"

"You always come to Thornhaven looking for someone," Jareth said. "And you—" He looked at Rachel again. "You have that look. New walker. Confused. Powerful." He shrugged. "Sivara's usually interested in new walkers. Especially powerful ones."

"Can you arrange an introduction?" Arathen asked.

"I can send word," Jareth said. "Whether she'll respond is her choice. She's particular about visitors."

"We'd appreciate the attempt," Arathen said.

Jareth nodded and made a note in his ledger. "I'll have someone take a message this afternoon. If she's interested, you'll hear back by evening."

"Thank you," Arathen said.

They climbed the stairs—wood that didn't creak, stairs that seemed to anticipate weight distribution and adjust accordingly. The rooms were simple but clean, beds that looked comfortable, windows that showed views of Thornhaven's impossible architecture.

Rachel ended up in a room with Maelin and Ilyra again, the three of them settling into a configuration that was becoming familiar. Maelin immediately claimed the bed near the window. Ilyra took the one with the best sightline to the door. Rachel got the middle bed by default.

"We should explore," Edrin said from the doorway connecting their rooms. "Get familiar with the town. It's been years since I've been here—things change."

"Things always change in Thornhaven," Arathen said. He'd appeared behind Edrin, looking tired in a way that suggested the journey was catching up with him. "But yes. We should orient ourselves. Just in case."

"In case of what?" Rachel asked.

"In case Sivara says no and we need to find another approach," Arathen said. "Or in case she says yes and we need to know evacuation routes."

"That's comforting," Rachel said dryly.

"It's practical," Ilyra corrected. "Never enter a situation without knowing the exits."

They ventured back out into Thornhaven together. The afternoon sun—still that faint green-washed light Rachel had learned to accept—painted the strange architecture in shades that almost looked normal. Almost.

The town revealed itself in layers. Surface level: shops and homes and public spaces that functioned the way such spaces should. Deeper level: the magic infrastructure that kept everything running—wards against fire, protections against weather, purification systems for water that worked without pipes or pumps. Deepest level: the boundary work itself, the reason Thornhaven existed in this location, the thin places between worlds that made the town possible and necessary simultaneously.

Rachel could feel all three layers. Could sense the surface routine, the magical underpinning, and beneath it all, the boundaries that pressed close here, places where realities almost touched.

It made her skin itch. Made her want to reach out and adjust things, smooth over rough spots, reinforce weak points. The boundaries here were maintained but not perfectly. There were gaps. Thin places that were too thin. Overlaps that shouldn't overlap.

"You feel it," Arathen said quietly. He'd been watching her again.

"The boundaries," Rachel confirmed. "They're not quite right. Not wrong enough to be dangerous, but—"

"But messy," Arathen finished. "Yes. Thornhaven exists because of boundary proximity, but it also makes boundary maintenance difficult. Too much traffic, too much interference. Demons do what they can, but there's always more work than there are workers."

"I could help," Rachel said before thinking.

Arathen's expression shifted. "You could. But I'd advise against it until after you've spoken with Sivara. Doing unsolicited boundary work in another walker's territory is—" He paused, searching for words. "Politically complicated."

"Demon politics again," Rachel said.

"Always demon politics," Arathen agreed.

They explored for hours. Found the market—stalls selling food and cloth and objects Rachel couldn't identify. Found the public well—water that flowed up from somewhere deep below, crystal clear and slightly sweet. Found the tower Rachel had seen from outside—closer up, even more impossible, spiraling upward in ways that made her dizzy to follow.

And everywhere, people. Beings. Creatures. Entities. Rachel had run out of words for the diversity around her. She saw someone who appeared to be made partly of smoke, someone else whose skin reflected like mirrors, a child who seemed to blink in and out of visibility like they couldn't quite decide whether to be solid.

No one stared at Rachel. No one backed away. A few people nodded at her in passing—acknowledgment, maybe recognition of what she was. But no fear. No hostility.

For the first time since the summoning, Rachel walked through a public space and didn't feel like she was performing.

"You're smiling," Maelin said.

Rachel touched her face. She was. "Is that weird?"

"It's nice," Maelin said. "You should smile more."

"Arathen said the same thing," Rachel said without thinking.

Maelin's eyebrow rose. "Did he?"

Rachel felt her face warm. "It's not—we were just talking—"

"I know what you were doing," Maelin said, amused. "And I'm not judging. Just observing."

Rachel decided to drop it. They were approaching what looked like a central square—a open space where multiple streets converged, fountain in the center that definitely shouldn't work the way it did, water flowing upward in defiance of gravity before cascading down in patterns that looked almost intentional.

People gathered here. Some sitting on benches carved from single pieces of wood, others standing in conversation clusters, a few children running between adults in that universal game of chase-and-be-chased.

Normal. Except for the magic. Except for the boundaries pressing close. Except for the fact that half the children playing had features that couldn't exist in Rachel's old world.

Normal for here, Rachel corrected herself. She was learning to recalibrate normal.

They returned to the inn as the light began to fail. Both moons were rising—large silver, small blue—casting their overlapping shadows across impossible architecture. Thornhaven at night was even more beautiful than during the day, bioluminescent patterns emerging on buildings, magical lights that weren't fire or electricity but something else entirely, colors that didn't quite match Earth's palette painting everything in shades Rachel had no names for.

Jareth met them at the door. "Message came back," he said. "Sivara will see you. Tomorrow morning, her residence in the eastern quarter. She sent a guide to meet you here at dawn."

"That was fast," Arathen said.

"She was curious," Jareth said. "About the new walker. Apparently word of your boundary work has reached her."

Rachel's stomach tightened. Of course it had. A collapse that size, stopped that completely—demons talked. Especially boundary walkers. Especially in a town like Thornhaven where boundary work was constant conversation.

"Tomorrow morning then," Arathen said.

They ate dinner in the common room—stew that tasted like beef but wasn't, bread that was slightly sweet, vegetables Rachel couldn't name but that were pleasantly familiar in texture if not flavor. Around them, other patrons carried on their own conversations in languages Rachel sometimes understood and sometimes didn't.

No one bothered them. No one stared. They were just travelers in a town of travelers, all of them between one place and another.

After dinner, Rachel stood at the window of her room, looking out at Thornhaven settling into night. The lights. The architecture. The boundaries pressing close like attention, like possibility.

Tomorrow she'd meet Sivara.

Tomorrow she'd get real answers about what she was, what that meant, how to control the power that kept expanding whether she wanted it to or not.

Tomorrow everything would change.

Again.

Rachel pressed her palm against the cool glass, feeling the wards humming beneath its surface. Somewhere out there, Sivara was preparing to meet her. A demon powerful enough to teach her. A boundary walker who might actually understand.

The fear was still there—it always was. But anticipation had joined it. Curiosity. Even a kind of excitement that felt dangerous to acknowledge.

She was ready.

Or as ready as she'd ever be.
