## Chapter Twenty-Nine

Rachel's first lesson with Sivara lasted four hours.

They covered theory—how boundaries worked, why they existed, what maintained them and what destabilized them. Sivara explained the fundamental difference between human magic (imposed will requiring constant energy) and demon magic (negotiated will working with reality's existing patterns). She drew diagrams that made Rachel's eyes hurt and made perfect sense simultaneously.

"You've been doing this instinctively," Sivara said, gesturing at the complex drawings spread across multiple surfaces. "When you fixed that collapse, you weren't forcing reality to obey you. You were reminding it of its own rules. That's advanced technique. Most walkers take years to learn it."

"I didn't know I was doing it," Rachel admitted.

"Exactly," Sivara said. "Your instincts are excellent. Your conscious understanding is non-existent. We need to bring those two things into alignment so you can work intentionally instead of accidentally."

By the end of the lesson, Rachel's head was spinning with information. Technical terms. Theoretical frameworks. Practical applications of concepts she'd been using without names. It was like suddenly discovering the grammar for a language she'd been speaking fluently but illiterately.

"Tomorrow," Sivara said as Rachel prepared to leave. "Same time. And Rachel—" She paused. "Think about what I said. About the suppression breaking deliberately. Someone designed it that way. Someone wanted you to awaken eventually."

"I will," Rachel promised.

She walked back through Thornhaven's evening streets, mind churning. The suppression had been intentional but temporary. A delayed awakening rather than permanent imprisonment. That changed the implications significantly—from abandonment to something more like... preparation? Protection with an expiration date?

Someone had planned for her to eventually become what she was.

But who? And why?

Back at the inn, her friends were waiting. They'd clearly been discussing something—conversation cutting off abruptly when Rachel entered, guilty expressions all around.

"What?" Rachel asked.

"Nothing," Maelin said, too quickly.

"That's a terrible lie," Rachel said. "What were you talking about?"

Arathen sighed. "We were discussing next steps. After your training with Sivara. What you'll do, where you'll go. Whether you'll stay in Thornhaven or—"

"Or what?" Rachel prompted.

"Or come with us," Edrin finished. "Back to the outpost. Continue traveling. Wherever we go next."

The question landed heavier than Rachel expected. She'd been so focused on immediate concerns—training, understanding, surviving—that she hadn't thought about the future beyond that.

What did she want to do with her life now that she knew what she was?

"I don't know," she admitted. "I haven't thought that far ahead."

"That's fair," Maelin said. "You've had a lot to process. But Rachel—" She moved closer. "Whatever you decide, wherever you go—you're still family. That doesn't change."

"Even if I stay here?" Rachel asked. "Train with Sivara long-term? Become a Thornhaven demon?"

"Even then," Arathen confirmed. "Geography doesn't change relationship."

The certainty in his voice made Rachel's chest tight. They'd been together less than three weeks. Three weeks of chaos and revelation and impossible situations. But somehow, in that short time, they'd become the most important people in her life.

More important than anyone in her old world had ever been.

"Thank you," Rachel said. "For not making me choose between you and understanding myself."

"Those shouldn't be mutually exclusive choices," Ilyra said. "Anyone who makes you choose doesn't deserve to be chosen."

That night, Rachel lay awake again, but this time her thoughts were less anxious spiraling and more genuine contemplation. What did she want? Not what she should want, not what would be safest or most practical, but what she actually wanted?

To understand her abilities fully. To use them safely. To help maintain boundaries that kept worlds intact. To be useful in ways that mattered instead of ways that just filled time.

To be herself without apology or suppression.

To be with people who saw her completely and chose her anyway.

The answers felt clear. Now she just had to figure out how to build a life around them.

The next three days followed a pattern. Mornings with Sivara—intensive lessons covering magical theory, practical applications, demon etiquette and politics. Afternoons with her friends—exploring Thornhaven, sharing meals, existing together without agenda. Evenings processing everything she'd learned, feeling her understanding grow layer by layer.

It should have been overwhelming. Somehow it wasn't. Or it was, but in a way that felt productive rather than destructive. Like building something instead of breaking under weight.

On the fourth day, Sivara's lesson took a different turn.

"I've been researching," she said without preamble. "Looking for records of other suppressed demons. Cases where boundary walkers were deliberately hidden. And I found something."

Rachel's pulse quickened. "What?"

"There's a pattern," Sivara said, pulling out texts that looked ancient. "Throughout history, when powerful boundary walkers emerge during periods of political instability, they sometimes disappear. Not died. Disappeared. Removed from active society until stability returns."

"So you think I was removed deliberately," Rachel said. "Because of political instability?"

"Possibly," Sivara said. "But here's what's interesting—the demons who handle these removals, who do the suppression work, who hide children across worlds for their own protection—" She looked at Rachel with those dimensional eyes. "They keep records. Careful records. Of who was hidden, when, why, and where."

Rachel's breath caught. "You think there's a record of me?"

"I think there might be," Sivara said carefully. "If you were hidden according to proper protocols, if someone followed established procedures rather than acting rogue—" She paused. "There should be documentation. Somewhere."

"How do we find it?" Rachel asked.

"We ask," Sivara said simply. "The organization that handles protective suppressions is called the Threshold Archive. They're based in the capital, three weeks' travel from here. If you want answers about your origins, that's where you'll find them."

Three weeks travel. To answers. To understanding. To potentially finding out who she'd been before suppression, who had hidden her, why.

"I want to go," Rachel said immediately.

"I thought you might," Sivara said. "But Rachel—there's no guarantee they'll have your records. Or that they'll share them if they do. The Archive is protective of its information. And—" She hesitated. "If your suppression was done outside official channels, if someone hid you without proper authorization, there won't be documentation. You'll have traveled three weeks for nothing."

"I have to try," Rachel said. "I need to know."

Sivara nodded slowly. "Then I'll write you letters of introduction. Formal requests for information. It won't guarantee access, but it will help." She paused. "Will you be traveling alone?"

"No," Rachel said with certainty. "My friends will come. If they're willing."

"Of course we're willing," Maelin said from the doorway.

Rachel turned. All four of them stood there—Maelin, Ilyra, Edrin, and Arathen. How long had they been listening?

"We came to check on you," Edrin explained. "Heard Sivara mention the Archive. We're coming with you."

"Three weeks is a long journey," Rachel said. "Dangerous, probably. You don't have to—"

"We know," Arathen interrupted. "We're coming anyway."

Rachel looked at them. At the people who'd seen her through impossible revelations and chosen to stay for more. Who could have walked away at any point but kept choosing forward.

"Okay," she said. "Okay. We'll go together."

They spent the next two days preparing. Gathering supplies. Planning the route. Sivara providing letters and recommendations and warnings about what they might encounter.

The morning they were set to leave, Rachel returned to Sivara's residence one final time.

"Thank you," Rachel said. "For teaching me. For helping me understand. For not treating me like a problem that needed solving."

"You're welcome," Sivara said. "But Rachel—" She moved closer, expression serious. "The Archive will have answers. But they might not be the answers you want. You might discover your past is painful. Or complicated. Or dangerous."

"I know," Rachel said. "But not knowing is worse."

"Perhaps," Sivara said. She reached out, placing a hand on Rachel's shoulder. "Be careful. Trust your instincts. And remember—who you were doesn't define who you are. You get to decide that yourself."

The words felt like blessing and warning simultaneously.

They left Thornhaven at dawn, the five of them setting out toward the capital with letters from Sivara and hope for answers. The journey would take three weeks minimum. Longer if they encountered complications. But they had time. They had supplies. They had each other.

And Rachel had purpose. Real purpose. Not just surviving or understanding, but actively seeking truth about who she'd been and why she'd been hidden.

The road ahead was uncertain. Potentially dangerous. Definitely complicated.

But when Rachel looked at her companions—at the found family who'd chosen three weeks of difficult travel just so she could find answers—she felt something she'd never quite felt before.

Hope.

Not the cautious, qualified hope that came with lowered expectations. Real hope. The kind that believed good things were actually possible.

They walked together into whatever came next.

And Rachel, for the first time in her life, believed she'd be okay.

Not despite being a demon.

Because of it.

Finally.

After twenty-six years of being the wrong thing.

She was learning to be the right thing.

And that had to be enough.

Because it was everything.

Everything she'd ever needed to be.
