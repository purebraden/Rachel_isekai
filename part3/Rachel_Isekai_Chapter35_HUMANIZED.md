## Chapter Thirty-Five

The visitor arrived at noon, announced by a disturbance in Thornhaven's boundaries that Rachel felt from three blocks away.

She was in the practice space with Sivara, working on maintaining multiple temporal fields simultaneously, when the pressure shifted. Not a tear or collapse—something deliberate. Someone powerful announcing their presence by making the boundaries acknowledge them.

Sivara went still. "That's... concerning."

"Who?" Rachel asked.

"Kael," Sivara said. "Boundary lord from the Eastern Territories. Powerful, political, and not someone who visits casually." She was already moving, abandoning the training. "Come on. If he's here, it's because he heard about you."

Rachel followed, pulse quickening. "Is that bad?"

"It's complicated," Sivara said. "Kael isn't an enemy. But he's not a friend either. He's a calculator. Everything is leverage, everything is negotiation. And you—" She glanced back. "You're unprecedented. That makes you valuable. Possibly asset, possibly threat, depending on how he chooses to see you."

They hurried through Thornhaven's streets. Other demons had noticed the disturbance too—Rachel saw Mirrel standing outside their residence, expression guarded. Senna appeared in a doorway, watching with temporal-specialist awareness.

Word would spread quickly.

Kael waited in the town square. He stood near the central fountain—a structure of living wood that spiraled up through itself in mathematical precision—and his presence dominated the space despite making no overt display of power.

He was tall, dark-skinned, with features that suggested mixed heritage from multiple worlds. Silver threaded through close-cropped hair. His clothing was simple but expensive—dark fabric that moved with unnatural fluidity, suggesting boundary-woven material. Around him, reality bent subtly, distances refusing to settle into normal geometry.

This was what a boundary lord looked like. Political power made manifest.

Rachel felt her own boundaries tighten instinctively—defensive posture she hadn't consciously chosen. Kael noticed immediately.

His eyes fixed on her. Silver-grey, sharp with intelligence. "You must be Rachel."

Not a question. Statement. He'd come specifically for her.

"I am," Rachel said, keeping her voice steady.

Kael's gaze swept over her—assessing, cataloging, measuring. Rachel felt examined in ways that went beyond physical. He was reading her boundary presence, her power signature, the patterns that defined her as demon.

"Interesting," he said finally. "The reports didn't do you justice."

"What reports?" Rachel asked.

"The boundary collapse repair," Kael said. "Word spreads among those who pay attention. An unprecedented demon stabilizing a major collapse without training—that's noteworthy. Worth investigating." He paused. "Worth meeting."

Sivara stepped forward, placing herself between Rachel and Kael without making it obvious. "She's under my instruction and protection. Any assessment happens with my participation."

Kael smiled slightly. "I wouldn't expect otherwise. You've always been careful with your students, Sivara. It's one of your better qualities." He gestured to nearby seating—stone benches arranged around the fountain. "May we talk? Formally?"

Formal meant witnessed. Public. Binding in ways that casual conversation wasn't.

"We may," Sivara said.

They arranged themselves carefully—Kael on one side, Rachel and Sivara on the other, with deliberate space maintained. A small crowd had gathered at the square's edges. Demons and humans both, drawn by curiosity and the undeniable presence of political theater.

"Rachel," Kael began, focusing entirely on her. "I'm going to ask questions. You're not obligated to answer, but understand that silence communicates information as clearly as words. We understand each other?"

"We do," Rachel said.

"Good." He leaned back slightly, casual but attentive. "Where were you born?"

"I don't know," Rachel said honestly. "I was adopted as an infant. Raised on Earth."

"Earth," Kael repeated. "Low-magic realm. How did a demon end up there?"

"Someone hid me," Rachel said. "Sealed my abilities, suppressed my nature. I only learned what I was when I was summoned to the March."

"Summoned by accident," Kael said. "I heard that part. Fascinating. Summoning magic reaching for one demon and pulling through another." His eyes narrowed slightly. "Unless it wasn't an accident. Unless the magic found exactly who it was looking for."

Rachel frowned. "What do you mean?"

"Summoning spells target resonance patterns," Kael explained. "They reach for specific signatures. If the spell reached for you instead of its intended target, that suggests your resonance was stronger. More present. More impossible to ignore." He paused. "That's not how suppression works. Sealed demons should be invisible to summoning magic. The fact that you weren't—that's anomalous."

Rachel exchanged a glance with Sivara, who looked troubled.

"I don't have answers for that," Rachel said.

"No," Kael agreed. "But someone does. Whoever sealed you, whoever hid you—they made choices that led to your unsealing. Accidentally or deliberately." He watched her carefully. "Do you know who sealed you?"

Rachel hesitated. Edrin's research had suggested telling people about Theryn would be politically significant. Making Rachel someone's daughter meant making her someone's heir.

But lying to a boundary lord seemed dangerous in different ways.

"I have theories," Rachel said carefully. "Not certainties."

Kael's expression suggested he understood exactly what she wasn't saying. "Theories you're not ready to share. Understandable. Wise, even." He shifted topics. "Your abilities. You manipulate time, space, and boundaries. That's not specialization. That's generalized power rarely seen outside ancient bloodlines."

"So I've been told," Rachel said.

"And you're untrained," Kael continued. "Yet you stabilized a collapse that should have been impossible to stop. How?"

Rachel considered her answer. "Instinct. I could see what was wrong. I knew how to fix it. So I did."

"Instinct." Kael's tone suggested skepticism. "Or inherited knowledge. Technique passed down through bloodline, dormant until activated."

"I don't know the difference," Rachel admitted.

"That's honest," Kael said. He was quiet for a moment, then: "Rachel. I'm going to be direct with you, because you deserve that much. Your existence is politically significant. An unsealed demon of your power level, with unclear lineage and no established allegiances—that creates instability. Some will see you as opportunity. Others as threat. A few might see you as both."

"What do you see me as?" Rachel asked.

Kael smiled. "I see you as someone who's going to disrupt existing power structures whether you intend to or not. The question is whether that disruption benefits or harms the territories I'm responsible for." He leaned forward slightly. "I'm not your enemy, Rachel. But I'm not automatically your ally either. I'm someone who needs to understand what you represent before I decide where you fit in the broader political landscape."

"That's honest," Rachel said, echoing his earlier words.

"It is," Kael agreed. He stood. "I've learned what I came to learn. Thank you for your time and your candor." He nodded to Sivara. "Take care of her. She's valuable. That makes her vulnerable."

"I'm aware," Sivara said coldly.

Kael turned to leave, then paused. "One more thing, Rachel. If anyone approaches you with offers of alliance or protection, be careful. Not everyone has your best interests at heart. Some might want to use you. Others might want to eliminate you. Trust carefully."

"I do," Rachel said.

Kael's smile was sharp. "Good. Survival requires that skill."

He walked away, and as he did, the pressure on Thornhaven's boundaries eased. The crowd that had gathered began to disperse, conversations already spreading through the town.

Sivara didn't move until Kael was completely out of sight. Then she let out a breath. "Well. That could have gone worse."

"Could it have gone better?" Rachel asked.

"Not really," Sivara admitted. "Kael is... Kael. He came, he assessed, he made his presence known. Now other boundary lords will know someone's taken interest in you. That will create ripples."

"Good ripples or bad ripples?" Rachel asked.

"Both," Sivara said. "Some will be curious. Others will be threatened. A few might decide you're worth eliminating before you become a problem." She looked at Rachel seriously. "You need to be more careful now. Kael's visit just elevated your political profile. You're not unknown anymore. You're noticed."

Rachel's stomach tightened. "What does that mean practically?"

"It means we accelerate your training," Sivara said. "It means you don't go anywhere alone. It means—" She stopped, attention shifting.

Rachel felt it too. A disturbance, smaller than Kael's arrival but more hostile. Sharp and predatory, moving toward them with purpose.

"Inside," Sivara said sharply. "Now."

They moved quickly, not quite running but close. Behind them, Rachel felt boundary signatures she didn't recognize. Multiple demons, coordinated, approaching with clear intent.

They reached Sivara's residence. The door sealed behind them with audible finality, wards activating.

"What was that?" Rachel asked.

"Opportunists," Sivara said grimly. "Kael's visit made you visible. And visibility attracts attention. Some of it unwelcome." She moved to a window, looking out carefully. "They're watching. Not attacking, just observing. Testing boundaries."

"Who?" Rachel asked.

"I don't know yet," Sivara said. "But we're going to find out."

That evening, after Rachel returned to the inn under escort from both Sivara and Ilyra, the group gathered to discuss what had happened.

"This is bad," Edrin said, stating the obvious. "If Kael's visit attracted immediate attention from hostile parties, Rachel's in more danger than we realized."

"We need better security," Ilyra said. "Guards, wards, protocols for movement. Rachel doesn't go anywhere without at least two of us."

"I'm not helpless," Rachel protested.

"No one thinks you are," Maelin said gently. "But Sivara's right—you're visible now. That makes you a target."

Arathen had been quiet, but his expression was dark with worry. "This is escalating faster than anticipated. We need to consider whether staying in Thornhaven is sustainable."

"Where else would we go?" Rachel asked.

"Somewhere less central," Arathen said. "Somewhere Rachel could continue training without being constantly visible to every boundary lord in the territories."

"Running won't help," Sivara said. She'd accompanied them back, concerned enough to breach her usual boundaries. "Rachel's presence is known now. Moving just makes her look like a threat trying to hide. Better to stand ground, establish legitimacy, demonstrate strength."

"While being watched by enemies," Ilyra said flatly. "Great plan."

"It's the only plan that doesn't make things worse," Sivara countered.

They argued strategy late into the night. Eventually, exhausted, they dispersed to their rooms with nothing fully resolved except heightened awareness of the danger.

Rachel stood at her window, looking out at Thornhaven. Somewhere out there, demons were watching. Calculating. Deciding whether she was opportunity or threat.

She'd been visible before—at home, at work, existing in spaces that never quite fit.

But this visibility was different. Dangerous. The kind that invited challenges she might not be equipped to handle.

Her mother had hidden her for a reason.

Now Rachel was exposed.

And something in the back of her mind whispered that Kael's visit might have been less assessment and more announcement.

Someone wanted everyone to know Rachel existed.

The question was why.

And what they planned to do about it.
