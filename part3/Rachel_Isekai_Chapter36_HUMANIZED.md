## Chapter Thirty-Six

The attack came at midnight, when Thornhaven's boundaries were thinnest.

Rachel woke to the sensation of wrongness—not a sound or movement, but a disturbance in the boundary fabric she'd learned to sense constantly. Something was pushing against Thornhaven's wards, testing them, looking for weakness.

She sat up, fully alert. Across the room, Maelin stirred.

"You feel that?" Rachel whispered.

"Yes," Maelin said. She was already moving, grabbing her knife from the bedside table. "Wake the others."

Rachel didn't need to. Doors were already opening—Ilyra emerged first, armed, expression sharp with readiness. Edrin followed, and then Arathen, who looked at Rachel with immediate concern.

Rachel's voice was tight. "Someone's breaking the wards."

"How many?" Ilyra asked.

Rachel extended her awareness carefully. The attackers weren't trying to hide their presence anymore—they'd committed to the assault. "Three. Maybe four. All demons. Powerful."

"Why aren't the town wards stopping them?" Edrin asked.

"Because they're being countered," Arathen said grimly. He'd moved to the window, looking out at Thornhaven's streets. "Someone's suppressing the defensive boundaries. Professional work."

A sound from downstairs—not loud, but definite. Movement. Entry.

They were inside the inn.

Ilyra moved to the stairs, listening. After a moment, she gestured: Three people. Coming up. Slow and deliberate.

Arathen positioned himself near Rachel. "Stay behind me."

Rachel stepped forward instead. "No. They're here for me. I'm not hiding."

"Rachel—" Maelin started.

"She's right," Ilyra interrupted. "If they want her, making them chase her just endangers everyone else in the building. Better to meet them on our terms." She looked at Rachel. "Can you fight?"

"I don't know," Rachel admitted. "I've never tried."

"You're about to learn," Ilyra said.

The assassins reached their floor.

Three of them, as Rachel had sensed. Demons, all of them radiating controlled power. They wore dark clothing, faces partially obscured, but their boundary presence was unmistakable. These were professionals—hunters who'd done this work before.

The lead assassin spoke, voice flat and businesslike. "Rachel, daughter of Theryn. You're coming with us."

"No," Rachel said simply.

"That wasn't a request," the assassin said. "Vex wants you alive, but he didn't specify undamaged. We can do this easy or hard."

Vex. The name Rachel didn't recognize but felt significant.

"Who's Vex?" she asked, buying time.

"Your problem," the assassin said. "Last chance. Come voluntarily."

"Or?" Rachel asked.

"Or we take you," the second assassin said. Her voice carried dark amusement. "And your friends get hurt trying to stop us."

Ilyra moved before anyone could respond. She was fast—faster than Rachel had ever seen her move—blade flashing toward the nearest assassin's throat.

The assassin blocked, but barely. Surprise flickered across their face.

Then everything erupted into violence.

The assassins scattered—one engaging Ilyra, another moving toward Arathen, the third coming directly at Rachel. Rachel felt time slow instinctively, her power responding to threat before her conscious mind could process it.

The assassin reaching for her moved through syrup-air, every motion exaggerated by temporal distortion. Rachel could see the attack coming—hands reaching, boundaries shifting to create a cage around her.

She pushed back.

Not with her hands. With her power. The boundaries the assassin was trying to form shattered like glass, fragments dispersing into nothing.

The assassin's eyes widened. "You're not suppressed at all."

"No," Rachel said. "I'm really not."

She reached for time around the assassin, not to pause but to slow. Seventy percent normal speed, enough to make every movement sluggish and predictable. The assassin struggled against it, power flaring to resist, but Rachel's grip was absolute.

Across the hall, Arathen fought with controlled precision, boundary manipulation meeting boundary manipulation in ways Rachel could sense but not quite see. Reality folded and unfolded between them, spaces becoming non-euclidean.

Ilyra fought with brutal efficiency, human physicality enhanced by decades of experience. She couldn't match the demon's power, but she understood anatomy, leverage, where to cut to disable without killing.

Maelin and Edrin weren't fighters, but they weren't useless either. Maelin threw something—a vial that shattered, releasing smoke that made the second assassin stumble and cough. Edrin was working some kind of ward, fingers moving in patterns that made the air shimmer.

Rachel felt her control over the slowed assassin slipping. They were fighting back, power surging against hers. Strong. Experienced. If this became a contest of endurance, Rachel might lose.

So she changed tactics.

Instead of slowing the assassin, she froze the space around them. Not time—space itself. The assassin's next movement carried them into the frozen pocket, and they stopped like hitting a wall.

Trapped. Contained. Not permanently, but long enough.

"Enough!" The lead assassin's voice cut through the chaos. They'd stopped fighting Arathen, hands raised in cessation. "We underestimated you. Won't happen again. This was reconnaissance as much as capture."

"Reconnaissance?" Arathen said coldly. "You call attacking in the night reconnaissance?"

"We call learning her capabilities reconnaissance," the lead assassin said. They looked at Rachel with something like respect. "You're stronger than reported. Faster. Better controlled. Vex will want to know that."

"Tell Vex," Rachel said, voice steadier than she felt, "that I'm not interested in whatever he wants."

"He'll be disappointed," the assassin said. "He was hoping for cooperation."

"Then he'll stay disappointed," Rachel said.

The assassin smiled grimly. "We'll see."

They moved—all three of them simultaneously—not attacking but retreating. Boundary magic flared, and they were gone. Not fled through doors or windows. Just gone, stepped sideways through boundaries into elsewhere.

Rachel released the spatial freeze she'd been maintaining and nearly collapsed from the sudden drain. Arathen caught her immediately, steadying her.

"I'm okay," Rachel gasped. "Just—that took effort."

"You did well," Arathen said. His hands were shaking slightly. "You fought off three trained assassins."

"We fought them off," Rachel corrected, looking at the others. Ilyra had a shallow cut on her arm. Maelin was breathing hard. Edrin's ward was still flickering, taking more concentration than he'd probably planned.

"Is everyone alright?" Maelin asked.

"Alive," Ilyra said, examining her wound. "Shallow. I've had worse." She looked at Rachel. "You can fight. That's good to know."

Doors were opening throughout the inn—other guests emerging, drawn by the commotion. Sivara appeared at the top of the stairs, power radiating concern and anger.

"What happened?"

"Assassins," Arathen said. "Three of them. Sent by someone named Vex to capture Rachel."

Sivara went very still. "Vex."

"You know him?" Rachel asked.

"I know of him," Sivara said grimly. "Ancient demon. Powerful. Territorial. And very, very patient when it comes to pursuing what he wants." She looked at Rachel. "If Vex sent assassins after you specifically, this isn't opportunistic. This is planned. He knows who you are."

"How?" Rachel asked.

"I don't know," Sivara said. "But we need to find out. Fast."

They spent the rest of the night securing the inn, reinforcing wards, questioning witnesses. The assassins had breached the building's defenses through careful, professional work—the kind that suggested they'd been studying Thornhaven's protections for days or longer.

By dawn, one concrete piece of information emerged: One of the assassins had left something behind. Not accidentally—deliberately. A calling card.

Ilyra held it carefully—a small medallion, black metal etched with a sigil Rachel didn't recognize. A serpent consuming its own tail, but inverted, inside-out in ways that hurt to look at.

"Vex's mark," Sivara confirmed. "He's claiming responsibility. Making sure we know this was personal, not random."

"Why?" Rachel asked. "What does he want with me?"

"I don't know yet," Sivara said. "But I'm going to find out. Vex doesn't act without reason. If he's targeting Theryn's daughter specifically—" She stopped. "He knew your mother. They had history. Probably bad history."

"So this is about her," Rachel said. "About something that happened twenty-six years ago."

"Or longer," Sivara said. "Demons have long memories. Vex has longer than most."

Arathen had been silent through most of the discussion, but his expression was dark with concern. As the others dispersed to their tasks—Edrin to research Vex, Ilyra to assess their security weaknesses, Maelin to help Sivara reinforce the wards—he pulled Rachel aside.

His voice dropped. "You can't stay here. If Vex is targeting you specifically, Thornhaven isn't safe."

"Nowhere is safe," Rachel countered. "You heard Sivara—running makes me look weak. Makes me look like prey."

"You are prey right now," Arathen said bluntly. "Powerful prey, but still hunted. We need to change that dynamic."

"How?" Rachel asked.

Arathen was quiet for a moment. "We go to the Council. Formally request protection and recognition. If you're under Council authority, attacking you becomes a political act, not a personal one. Vex is powerful, but he's not suicidal. He won't risk the Council's wrath."

"Unless he has Council support," Rachel said. "We don't know who's on what side."

"No," Arathen agreed. "But the alternative is fighting off assassins until one of them succeeds. Or until Vex escalates." His expression was raw with concern. "Rachel, I can't—" He stopped, restarted. "I can't watch you be hunted. It's not acceptable. We need political protection, formal standing. Something that makes you unchallengeable."

Rachel understood what he wasn't saying. The fear beneath the words. The way his hands had shaken after the fight. The careful distance he was maintaining now because he was afraid if he got closer, he'd hold onto her and not let go.

She stepped closer anyway. "I'm not going to let Vex dictate my choices. If we go to the Council, it's because we decide it's the right move, not because we're running scared."

"Then decide," Arathen said. "Because I'm terrified of what happens if we don't."

The admission cost him something. Rachel could see it in the way he looked at her—not mentor to student, but person to person. Someone who cared deeply and was trying desperately to keep that care from clouding his judgment.

"Alright," Rachel said. "We consider the Council. We research Vex. We prepare. But I'm not leaving Thornhaven tonight. I'm not fleeing in the dark from an attack I survived."

"That's pride talking," Arathen said.

"That's survival talking," Rachel corrected. "If I run every time I'm threatened, I'll never stop running. Better to stand, learn from this, and be prepared for next time."

"There will be a next time," Arathen warned.

"I know," Rachel said. "And I'll be ready for it."

She hoped that was true.

Because Vex's mark sat on the table downstairs, black metal catching morning light, a promise of violence to come.

And Rachel had just learned she could fight.

But fighting wasn't the same as winning.

The question was what happened when Vex escalated beyond assassins.

When he came for her himself.

Whether she'd be ready for that.

Whether any of them would be.
